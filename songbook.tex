\chapter{NORTHWEST PASSAGE - Stan Rogers}
\setcounter{page}{1}

\begin{verbatim}
from the album "Northwest Passage"
(c) 1981 Fogarty's Cove Music Inc.

               D        A            G                  Bm
        Ah for just one time I would take the Northwest Passage
           G                D                 Em               G
        To find the hand of Franklin reaching for the Beaufort Sea
                D        A              G                Bm
        Tracing one warm line through a land so wide and savage
            G                D       A      D
        And make a Northwest Passage to the sea

Westward from the Davis Strait, 'tis there was said to lie
The sea route to the orient for which so many died
Seeking gold and glory, leaving weathered broken bones
And a long forgotten lonely cairn of stones

Three centuries thereafter I take passage over land
In the footsteps of brave Kelso where his "sea of flowers" began
Watching cities rise before me then behind me sink again
This tardiest explorer driving hard across the plains

And through the night behind the wheel, the mileage clicking west
I think upon Mackenzie, David Thompson, and the rest
Who cracked the mountain ramparts and did show a path for me
To race the roaring Fraser to the sea

How then am I so different from the first men through this way
Like them, I left a settled life, I threw it all away
To seek a Northwest Passage at the call of many men
To find there but the road back home again

\chapter{Famous Inside}
Capo 3rd fret works good
\begin{verbatim}
      G
I can almost hear some of you say,
       G
"You'd think he'd have more sense at his age,
    C
The crazy old man in the old tam-o-shanter's
        G
Getting carried away."

Sometimes it's almost too much to stand,
But it's not my place to take you in hand.
It used to be a man and his madness
Were as sacred as the coming of day.

It's strange how things will stick in the mind.
You'd think the years would leave them behind,
But long ago moments as a winner
Kind of push the recent memories aside.

Symptomatic, you say, of old age,
But it's something that nobody can gage.
It may be that I've sorted out the memories I can keep
And thrown the others away.

D
There's some who would say, "Just let him sit and decay",
      C                              G
But I really can't believe that it's true.
        F#7
There's bits of yourself you always have to live up to
   C                    D7
If only for a moment or two!

There's little time to spend sitting down,
When feeling good means moving around,
And I can't be blamed if I remember my name
And why it made me so proud.

There's some who would say, "Just let him sit and decay",
But I really can't believe that it's true!
There's bits of yourself you always have to live up to,
If only for a moment or two!

At my age I do as I choose,
And shouldn't need to make an excuse.
I know that you all feel a little famous inside
And I'm no different than you.
I know that you all feel a little famous inside,
And I'm no different than you.

God damn them all, I was told,

When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight

With our cracked four-pounders, we made to fight

The Yankee lay low down with gold

She was broad and fat and loose in stays

But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days

        1         *         5        1
Then at length we stood two cables a-way

Our cracked four-pounders made an awful din

But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in


    1        *         5              1
The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
      *      4      1          5     (*)
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now

Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs

\chapter{THE WOODBRIDGE DOG DISASTER}
(Written by Royston Wood as performed by Stan Rogers)
\begin{verbatim}
There was an old woman in Woodbridge, there was,
So proper and tidy and all of those things,
She would wander all day with her duster in hand.
She was one of those women who cleaned where they stand,
And while she is at it she sings, boys!
And while she is at it, she sings!

Now, there's no doubt about it, her house was a show,
With everything proper and stowed in its place,
And that's why her dustbins had a shed of their own.
Like a mirror, each one of those bins it had grown!
You could read every line in your face, boys!
You could read every line in your face!

Now, there's nothing the matter with tidiness, no,
No matter with keeping your house up to scratch,
But these bins were located one side of a yard,
Where a Doberman Pinscher was prowling on guard,
Trained to kill if you lifted the latch, boys!
Trained to kill if you lifted the latch!

Now it's all very well to protect what is yours,
And it's better not leaving temptation around,
But a job on the "dust" is rewarding enough,
And there's nothing like taking the smooth with the rough,
To be savaged by some bloody hound, boys!
To be savaged by some bloody hound!

Now, this Doberman Pinscher would play in the yard,
And a couple of old tennis balls as its game.
In his make-believe game, it's himself that he saw,
As the world's only dog with a bionic jaw,
And that's when the garbage-man came, boys!
And that's when the garbage-man came!

Now, fate took a hand on this coldest of days,
For his wife, she had made him to wear a warm coat,
And to knot up his muffler to keep out the chill,
And, for once in his life, he had bent to her will,
And the dog couldn't get at his throat, boys!
And the dog couldn't get at his throat!

Now, when the woman above was drawn to the noise,
It's down from a high chamber-window she calls,
To the dustman, engaged in a struggle for life,
In a middle-class tone you could cut with a knife,
She loudly exclaimed, "Kick his balls!" boys!
She loudly exclaimed, "Kick his balls!"

Now, the dustman could scarcely believe the command,
But he didn't have time to request it again,
So ignoring distinction of language and class,
He unleashed a size ten at the Doberman's ass,
And its eyes misted over with pain, boys!
And its eyes misted over with pain!

Now, imagine the silence that followed that blow,
With the command ringing on in the poor dustman's ears,
And as the poor doggie lay writhing around,
He could see the two tennis balls there on the ground,
And her meaning was rendered quite clear, boys!
And her meaning was rendered quite clear!

Now, I'd like to explain that this dog was "at stud",
And the dustman was sued for the fees that he'd lost,
But it's lucky he was to escape with his life!
He went home with a kiss for his poor startled wife,
Who harangued him for what it might cost, boys!
Who harangued him for what it might cost!

Now, if there's a moral to be gained from this song,
It's that innocent language might sometimes sound crude,
And as in the case of the carpenter's mate,
Your linguistic enlightenment might arrive late,
And you could end up getting screwed, boys!
And you could end up getting screwed!

\chapter{Love will Endure}
\begin{verbatim}
     G                       C                G
When first I came to town, I came in from the country.
      G                             C            G
Not a penny did I have, and not one cent could I offer.
    Em                              G                  D7
But still our love was new, and our troubles they were few,
           G
They were few.

Many times I tried to tell you all the hurt that I was feelin'
But my thoughts stumbled in my mind, and my words lost their meanin'
I didn't mean to cause you pain, so I'm leavin' once again
Once again.

There is no need to think of me. I'll be happy where I'm going.
I've got roots that need a-plantin' and a love that needs a-growin',
Where my pride won't have to bend, and my lips can taste wind,
Taste the wind.

And as for you, your tears will heal all the wounds that have been opened,
Just as time will clear the fields of all the flowers that have ripened,
And of all these things, you can be sure only love
Will endure.

\chapter{Patterns}
\begin{verbatim}
Written by Paul Simon

    Dm          
The night sets softly
                         F    Dm     
With the hush of falling le-e-eaves,
                     
Casting   shivering shadows
                          C            
On the houses through the trees,
        Dm                  
And the light from a street lamp
                       F    Dm   
Paints a pattern on my wa-a-all,
                       C
  Like the pieces of a puzzle
     Bb      C        Dm           
Or a child's   uneven scrawl

     Dm                  
Up a narrow flight of stairs
                   F    Dm   
In a narrow little ro-o-oom,
                  
As I lie upon my bed
                     C            
In the early evening gloom.
  Dm                 
Impaled on my wall
                  F    Dm   
My eyes can dimly se-e-e
                   C
 The pattern of my life
        Bb     C        Dm        
And the puzzle  that is me.

         Dm              
From the moment of my birth
                     F    Dm    
To the instant of my de-e-eath,
                           
There are Patterns I must follow
                            C             
Just as I must breathe each breath.
       Dm             
Like a rat in a maze
                   F    Dm   
The path before me li-I-ies,
                       C
 And the pattern never alters
  Bb  C        Dm          
Until  the rat dies.

        Dm                  
And the pattern still remains
                           F    Dm    
On the wall where darkness fe-e-ell,
                          
And it's fitting that it should,
                        C            
For in darknesss I must dwell.
         Dm                
Like the color of my skin,
                       F     Dm   
Or the day that I grow o-o-o-old,
                   C
My life is made of Patterns
         Bb       C      Dm             
That can scarcely  be controlled.

|G          |C      |      |G   |   |
  I hear the drizzle of the rain

Am      |Em |C    |Bm7  |   |
  Like a memory it falls 

G         |Bm     |G  |C  |  |
  Soft and warm continuing 

Am       |Em   |D       |G     C|G  |  C|G  |
  Tapping on my roof and walls.


G           |C      |     |G   |   |
And from the shelter of my mind

Am           |Em    |C    |Bm7 |   |
  Through the window of my eyes

G         |Bm     |G            |C      |  |
 I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets

Am  |Em     |D             |G    C|G  |  C|G  |
  To England where my heart lies.


G             |C      |      |G    |   |
  My mind's distracted and diffused

Am  |Em          |C          |Bm7 |   |
  My thoughts are many miles away

G              |Bm      |G      |C    |  |
  They lie with you when you're asleep

Am   |Em      |D                  |G   C|G  |  C|G  |
  And kiss you when you start your day.

  And a song I was writing is left undone

  I don't know why I spend my time

G       |Bm     |G      |C    |  |
 Writing songs I can't believe

Am               |Em      |D        |G   C|G  |  C|G  |
  With words that tear and strain to rhyme.


|G          |C         |       |G    |   |
  And so you see I have come to doubt

Am        |Em    |C      |Bm7 |   |
  All that I once held as true

G       |Bm       |G    |C    |  |
 I stand alone without beliefs

  The only truth I know is you.


|G        |C       |        |G   |   |
  And as I watch the drops of rain

Am           |Em   |C        |Bm7 |   |
  Weave their weary paths and die

G           |Bm  |G       |C   |  |
 I know that I am like the rain

Am                 |Em      |D     |G  C|G  |  C|G  |
  There but for the grace of you go I.

In restless walks she'll prowl the night;

July-y, she will fly-y-y

Am          Em     |Fmaj7    Em
And give no warning to her flight.

A-a-august, die she must,

The autumn winds blow chilly and cold;

September I'll remember.

Past the shadows dark and deep

  |Bm             |Cmaj7      |G      |C G
My mind dances and leaps in confusion.

       |            |Bm
I don't know what is real,

I can't touch what I feel

But I'm not sure at all it's my reflection.

Of God and truth and right

To play the King or pawn

Becomes reality,

Send out for whiskey, baby,
Send out for gin,
Me and room service, honey,
Me and room service, babe,
Me and room service,
For we're livin' the life of sin.

When I ain't drinkin', baby,
You are on my mind,
When I ain't sleepin', honey,
When I ain't sleepin', babe,
When I ain't sleepin', well,
You know you'll find me crying.

(refrain)

Livin' is a gamble, baby,
Lovin's much the same,
Wherever I have played,
Wherever I've thrown those dice,
Wherever I have played,
The blues run the game.

Maybe when I'm older, baby,
Someplace down the line,
I'll wake up older,
So much older, mama,
Wake up older and I'll just stop all my tryin'.

Dm7                      |C      |
   Hello darkness, my old friend,

                            |Dm   |
 I've come to talk with you again,

F6                       |Bb  F    |
  Because a vision softly creeping,

                           |Bb  F    |
 Left its seeds while I was sleeping,

        |Bb             |             |F
 And the vision that was planted in my brain

       |     |
Still remains

Dm F           |C       |Dm     |
     Within the sound of silence


Dm7                            |C   |
   In restless dreams I walked alone

                        |Dm    |
 Narrow streets of cobblestone,

           F6       |Bb     F    |
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,

                         |Bb       F   |
I turned my collar to the cold and damp

       |Bb                      |               |F
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light

              |     |
That split the night

Dm F               |C       |Dm      |
    And touched the sound of silence.


Dm7                        |C  |
   And in the naked light I saw

                          |Dm  |
Ten thousand people, maybe more

F6                      |Bb  F    |
  People talking without speaking,

                      |B b  F    |
People hearing without listening,

              |Bb        |            |F
People writing songs that voices never share

          |     |
And no one dared

Dm F           |C       |Dm     |
    Disturb the sound of silence


Dm7                           |C   |
   "Fools" said I, "You do not know

                     |Dm   |
Silence like a cancer grows

F6                          |Bb    F   |
  Hear my words that I might teach you,

                         |Bb    F    |
Take my arms that I might reach you"

      |Bb        |                |F
But my words like silent raindrops fell,

   |      |
And echoed

Dm F      |C       |Dm     |
    In the wells of silence


Dm7                        |C     |
   And the people bowed and prayed

                    |Dm   |
To the neon god they made.

        F6                  |Bb F    |
And the sign flashed out its warning,

                        |Bb F    |
In the words that it was forming.

                       |Bb                       |
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are 

                     |F
written on the subway walls

            |       |
And tenement halls."

Dm F                    |C       |Dm      |
    And whisper'd in the Sound of Silence.

I'm a rambler.  I'm a gambler.

      C    G   Am    D
I can make out on my own.

'Cause it's dark, and it's rainin'.
And the moon gives no light.
And my pony can hardly travel,
On this darkened road at night.

You know once I had a true love.
Lord, her age was just sixteen.
She was the flower of Belton,
And the rose of Aberdeen.

But her parents did not like me.
And now she feels much the same.
If I'm writ' on your diary,
Well, blot out my name.

'Cause there's changes in the ocean.
And there's changes in the sea.
And there's changes in my own true love,
But there ain't no change in me.

And they wither with the wind,

        |Em7            |A7   |  |
And they crumble in your hand.


D      |         |Em             |A7       |D    |
Once my heart was filled with the love of a girl.

I held her close, but she faded in the night

I am just a poor boy.

                        |Am
Though my story's seldom told,

      |G              |
I have squandered my resistance

     |G7            |                 |C       |  |
For a pocket full of mumbles, Such are promises

             |Am
 All lies and jest

Still a man hears what he wants to hear

   |              |C    |G |  |  |C |  |  |
And disregards the rest.


      | 
When I left my home

      |
And my family,

     |              Am
I was no more than a boy

      |G         |
In the company of strangers

      |G7          |                |
In the quiet of the railway station,

Running scared,

 Laying low,

Where the ragged people go

Looking for the places

Ooo-la-la la-la la-la

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes

And wishing I was gone,

Going home

 Where the New York City winters

Of ev'ry glove that laid him down

These old hills are my home but I've seen them for too long
I'm gonna burn up the road and be on our way we'll reach the sea by 
dawn  - I wanna be by your side
I wanna be by your side

I can get on the road see leaves that are green if I don't wait 'til fall
I can be at the end with my two feet in the sand sun setting with kisses on my
hand - I wanna be by your side
I wanna be by your side.

\chapter{Kathy With A Ks Song }
\begin{verbatim}
Chords by Bright Eyes tabs


        G           C
Love is real, it is not
        D             G
just in novels or the movies
      G                       C
It is fact And it is standing here
         D
right in front of you

So if you open your eyes
oh what a sweet discovery
There is hope, and there is joy
and there is acceptance

      C                          D
So now let all of the light that collects on your plants
         Bm             G
Keep you warm, make you smile
    C                         D
And I will be there with this pen in my hand
    Bm7           G
To record all the while
          C           D             Bm7                    A7
You'll be laughing so loud that the house would shake with sound
    C                     D                     G
And everything will be as new as the day it was found

(bridge)
Am Bm C D
      ohhhh

Love is real it is not
just in long distance commercials
Or something that you thought you felt
back in high school

So I will turn black and white
Become that horoscope you're reading
It predicts something good
is on its way


        C                        D
Oh, and then I will send you the world green and blue
     Bm              G
In a box through the mail
    C                    D
You can open it up, hold it right in your hand
       Bm7            G
And be glad that it's there
       C                D
And be glad that you're there
            Bm7                                         A7
Now you can feel all the knots in your stomach start to untie
    C                    D                      G
And suddenly it's not so hard to say you're all right

(bridge)
Am Bm C D
      ohhhh

Love is real, it is not
just in poetry and stories
It is truth, and it will follow you
Everywhere you go from now on

So if you'd just cast off your doubt
Then your lips would answer for you
Oh my darling, when you smile, it is like a song
And I can hear it now

And I can hear it now (repeat, screaming, with power chords)

Capo on 3

    C             G         C
If you walk away, I'll walk away
      C             G             C
First tell me which road you will take
  Am            G              C             Am
I don't want to risk our paths crossing some day
   C                  G              C
So you walk that way, I'll walk this way


        C            G        C
And the future hangs over our heads
       C               G       C
And it moves with each current event
  Am               G             C           Am
Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain
     C                 G            C
Just stay in when it's looking this way

        C             G          C
And the moon's laying low in the sky
        C          G        C
Forcing everything metal to shine
        Am             G                 C             Am
And the sidewalk holds diamonds like the jewelry store case
     C                    G             C
They argue walk this way, now walk this way

    C        G           C
And Laura's asleep in my bed
       C           G            C
As I'm leaving she wakes up and says
   Am               G                   C         Am
"I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave

Baby don't go away, come here"

And there's kids playing guns in the street

And ones pointing his tree branch at me
     Am           G         C         Am
So I put my hands up I say "enough is enough,
   C             G          C
If you walk away, I'll walk away"
And he shot me dead

Am          G      C
I found a liquid cure
    Am  G          C
From my landlocked blues
      F    G           C    Am
It'll pass away like a slow parade
     C             G              C
It's leaving but I don't know how soon 

        C              G     C
And the world's got me dizzy again
                C          G            C
You think after twenty-two years I'd be used to the spin
       Am         G            C           Am
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
       C             G                  C
So I'm always pacing around or walking away

       C            G           C
I keep drinking the ink from my pen
        C         G             C
And I'm balancing history books up on my head
       Am        G           C        Am
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase
       C               G       C
If you love something, give it away

       C          G        C
A good woman will pick you apart
      C       G                    C
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
        Am     G                C      Am
But you may be offended and you may be afraid
    C                G          C
But don't walk away, don't walk away

With the noise in the background of a televised war
           Am        G                    C             Am

I feel more like a stranger each time I come home

So I'm making a deal with the devils of faith

Saying "let me walk away, please"

You'll be free child once you have died

From the shackles of language and immeasurable time

And then we can trade places, play musical grace

the morning's born
and the morning shines
with the lights of love
You will miss sunrise
if you close your eyes
that would break
my heart in two

The lady's with me now
since I showed her how
to lay her lily
hand in mine
Loop and Lil agree
she's a sight to see
and a treasure for
the poor to find

Chorus

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery,
None but ourselves can free our minds.
Have no fear for atomic energy,
'Cause none of them can stop the time.
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Yes, some say it's just a part of it.
We've got to fulfill the book.
Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever had, redemption songs,
These songs of freedom, songs of freedom.

Tangled up in blue.

Verse 2:

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess,
But I used a little too much force.
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best.
She turned around to look at me
As I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder,
"We'll meet again someday on the avenue,"
Tangled up in blue.

Verse 3:

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell.
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix.
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind,
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.

Verse 4:

She was workin' in a place
And I stopped in for a beer,
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear.
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same,
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.

Verse 5:

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said
"You look like the silent type."
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century.
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
Tangled up in blue.

Verse 6:
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs,
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air.
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died.
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn,
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,
Tangled up in blue.

Verse 7:

So now I'm goin' back again,
I got to get to her somehow.
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now.
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives.
Don't know how it all got started,
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same,
We just saw it from a different point of view,
Tangled up in blue.

\begin{verbatim}
by Michelle Dockrey, (c) 2004

           D                            C
When the stars shine bright through the engine's trail
         F                      Am     Dm   Dm
And the dust of another world drops behind
          F                 C
When my ship is free of the open sky
          F                   Am     Dm    Dm
It's a damn good day to my way of mind
There's a barren planet you never can leave
There's a rocky valley where we lost a war
There's a cross once hung round a soldier's neck
There's a man's faith died on Serenity's floor

        F                       Am       Dm    Dm
But I stood my ground and I'll fly once more
It's the last oath that I ever swore

  D            C
Take my love, take my land
  G              D       A
Take me where I cannot stand
F              C
I don't care, I'm still free
 G                  D       A   A
You can't take the sky from me
Take me out into the black
Tell 'em I ain't comin' back
Burn the land and boil the sea
You can't take the sky from me
 F                  C       D   D
You can't take the sky from me

When you see a man and he's standin' alone
Well you might just take him for an easy mark
And there's many a man has tried his hand
And there's worse than wolves in the borderland dark
From the savage men to the government hounds
Try to take what's yours and tear you through
But them that run with me's got my back
It's a fool don't know that his family's his crew
Don't you tell me what I cannot do
Don't you think I've got to run from you

[Chorus]

When you've walked my road and you've seen what I've seen
Well you won't go talkin' 'bout righteous men
You'll know damn well why I want to keep to my sky
Never cry 'neath nobody's heel again
I've seen torment raked 'cross innocent souls
Seen sane men mad and good men die
I've been hounded, hated, married and tricked
Been tortured, cheated, shot and tied

You won't see no tears when I say goodbye
I've still got my family and my Firefly

[Chorus]
Last line of last chorus:
 F                  C    C        D (single strum) 
You can't take the sky       from me

Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule,
          C                    G       D
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black.
  G                       Em                       C
I held my tongue, as she told me "Son, fear is the heart of love"

So I never went back.

But it's nothing to cry about,

'Cause we'll hold each other soon in the blackest of rooms.

If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied,

Way out to the way out to the setting sun

The muskrat and the bullfrog
The rabbit and the skunk
Old barns full of blue sky
Backyards full of junk

Flat stuff, flat stuff
Way out to the way out to the setting sun

You can't find no river
That ain't low and brown
It's full of sixteen catfish
Who just lay there farting aroun'

Flat stuff, flat stuff
Way out to the way out to the setting sun

Pete hollers to Ruthie
"Open me a beer.
When you get it open,
Bring it over here."

Flat stuff, flat stuff
Way out to the way out to the setting sun





The sun looks like a cookie
That didn't come out right
Ah, the moon looks like a cookie
And someone stole a bite

Flat stuff, flat stuff
Way out to the way out to the setting sun

When them old boys come through
Sometimes I think it would have been best
If they'd said, "Jesus, it's too flat here"
And just kept going West.

Out of the flat stuff, flat stuff
Way out to the setting sun.

Take me to the breaking of a beautiful dawn
Take me to place where we came from
Take to me to the end so I can see the start
There’s only one way to mend a broken heart

Take me to the place where I can feel so small
Take me where I don’t have to stand so tall
Take me to the end so I can fall apart
There’s only one way to mend a broken heart

Take me where love is not for sale
Take me where are hearts are not so frail
G C D G
Take me where the fire still owns its spark
There’s only one way to mend a broken heart

Teach me how to see when I close my eyes
Teach to forgive and to apologize
G C D G
Show me how to love in the darkest dark
There’s only one way to mend a broken heart

Take me where the angels are close on hand
Take me where the ocean meets the sky and land
Show me the very first evening star

Take me where courage doesn’t need a name

Verse:
Bm                        F#7
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
A                     E7
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
G                         D
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Em                                        F#7
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim; I had to stop for the night.

Bm                              F#7
There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
A                                            E7
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
G                        D
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
Em                                  F#7
There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say...

Chorus:
G                        D 
Welcome to the Hotel California... 
       F#7                                      Bm        F#7(on C#)Bm(on D)
Such a lovely place,(such a lovely place)such a lovely face...
G                               D
Plenty of room at the Hotel California... 
    Em                                     F#7
Any time of year,(any time of year)you can find it here...

Verse:
Bm                           F#7
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes Bends
A                                     E7
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
G                                D
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Em                      F#7
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine"
G                                       D
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Em                                     F#7
Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say...

Such a lovely place,(such a lovely place)such a lovely face...

What a nice surprise,(what a nice surprise)bring your alibis...

Verse:
Bm                      F#7
Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
              A                               E7
And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
G                                  D
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
Em                                              F#7
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast

Bm                           F#7
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
A                                 E7
I had to find the passage back to place I was before
G                                   D
"Relax" said the night man, "We are programmed to receive.
Em                                   F#7
You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave".

Capo on 5th Fret
G                   D
I am thinking its a sign that the freckles
       Cadd9
In our eyes are mirror images
    G                  D
And when we kiss their perfectly alighned
    G                D
And I have to speculate that god himself
    Cadd9                      G
Did make us into corresponding shapes
            D
Like puzzle pieces from the clay
    G                          D
And true, it might seem like a stretch
                                Cadd9
But its thoughts like this that catch
                           G
My troubled head when your away
         D
And I am missing you today
     G                        D
When you are out there on the road
                     Cadd9
For several weeks of shows and when you scan
        G             D
The radio I hope this song will guide you home

G                            D
They will see us waving from such greak heights
      Cadd9             G      D
"Come down now" they'll say
    G                             D
But everything looks perfect from far away

Machine but the persistant beat it sounded

Thin upon listening
    G                     D
And that frankly will not fly, you will hear

The shrillest highs and lowest lows with

The windows down when this is guideing you home

Down the track came a   hobo,   hiking,

And the     sun shines ev'ry    day

On the  birds and the   bees and the    cigarette   trees,

The     lemonade    springs where the   bluebird    sings

And the     hens lay soft-boiled    eggs.

The     farmer's trees are full of fruit

Oh I'm  bound to    go, where there     ain't no    snow,

And the     little streams of   alcohol

Come a- trickling down the  rocks.
    C
The     brakemen have to tip their hats
        F           C
And the     railroad bulls are  blind,

There's a   lake of     stew and of     whiskey,     too,

You can     paddle all a-   round 'em in a  big ca- noe

And if you were a kiss, I know I'd be a hug

Peaches in the summertime,
Dm     (C)    Dm
Apples in the fall,

If I can't get the girl I love,
Am                 Dm
Won't have none at all.

Once I was a little boy,
Playin' in the sand,
Now I am a great big boy,
I think myself a man,

Chorus

When I was a little boy,
I wanted a whittlin' knife;
Now I am a great big boy
And I want a little wife.

Chorus

Wish I had a banjo string,
Made of golden twine,
And every tune I'd pick on it
Is "I wish that girl were mine."

Chorus

Some come here to fiddle and dance,
Some come here to tarry,
Some come here to fiddle and dance,
I come here to marry.

Chorus

Every night when I go home,
My wife, I try to please her,
The more I try, the worse she gets,
Damned if I don't leave her.

Chorus 2:
Shady grove, my little love,
Shady grove, my darlin',
Shady grove, my little love,
I'm going back to Harlan.

Fly around, my blue-eyed girl,
Fly around, my daisy,
Fly around, my blue-eyed girl,
Nearly drive me crazy.

Chorus 2

The very next time I go that road
And it don't look so dark and grazy,  
The very next time I come that road
I'll stop and see my daisy.

\begin{verbatim}
[Verse]
[G]I saw her there [C]fade from a[G]far
[G]Her hair gray char[C]coal
Takes a [G]drag from her [D]tar.
I [C]kissed her a [D]smile,
but her [G]blood red shot [C]eyes
Said "the [C]son never [D]shines on closed [G]doors."

[Verse]
[G]It's been eight long [C]years since I [G]saw
The [G]woman who's [C]labored
Since the [G]day I was [D]born.
Those [C]wrinkles now [D]face
To that [G]cold dark damp [C]place,
Where the [C]son never [D]shines on closed [G]doors.

[Chorus]
She said the [C]son never [D]shines on closed [G]doors
I [C]open to [D]find only [G]hurricanes [D]blow.
[C]Takes me [D]away, to the [G]green fields of [C]May,
Because the [C]son never [D]shines on closed [G]doors.

[Verse]
[G]Death comes like a [C]thief in the [G]night
To [G]steal while you [C]sleep,
the soul's [G]flickering [D]light.
Well [C]maybe it's [D]then,
she said I'll [G]see you [C]again,
Because the [C]son never [D]shines on closed [G]doors.

[Chorus]
She said the [C]son never [D]shines on closed [G]doors
I [C]open to [D]find only [G]hurricanes [D]blow.
[C]Takes me [D]away, to the [G]green fields of [C]May,
Because the [C]son never [D]shines on closed [G]doors.

And we [D]all go the [C]same way [G]home,
yeah we [D]all go the [C]same way [G]home. [Repeat until end]

\chapter{Black Friday Rule}
\begin{verbatim}
Intro:  Em G D Em(3x)
    Em D Em

(just drums)
I want to believe in myself once again
So I dream of a man whose hopes never end
To kiss with a girl who's as lovely as you
I'd give you my heart, if you gave me the truth

Verse
    G                                  D
And for every tear that is lost from an eye
    B                    Em
I'd dig me a well where no man could destroy
  G                                  D
I want to believe in a freedom that's bold
    B
But all I remember is the freedom of old

       Em        G          D          Em
Well I lost me a wife, so I found me a plane
D                          Em
Flew all the way to California
     Em         G         D            Em
This mess in my head is a mess getting out
   D                                       Em
Ya drink too much coffee, I drink too much stout

Verse
But after a while, when my mouth's not so dry
I'll dance up a storm, sure life's looking fine
But as darkness falls, I return to my bed
Don't ask me more questions, don't fuck with my head

          Em           G      D               Em
I've been down in this world, down and almost broken
     Em           D                              Em
Like thousands of people, left standing in their shoe
          Em           G      D               Em
I've been down in this world, down and almost broken
   Em             D                            Em
As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule

Solo (mess around on Em)

(only drums)
The buildings they shake but my heart it beats still
Oh mother of Jesus, I feel pretty ill
I want to go home where my feet both feel safe
But there ain't no jobs in the old free state

Verse
So I must remain in my new adopted land
I'm doing the best, Hell I'm doin' all I can
So next time you see me, don't ask for my name
  B
For I am the King and sure long may I reign

Chorus 2x

Beneath the stains of time   the feeling disappears

You are someone else   I am still right here

Well I've heard there was a secret chord
     G                    Em
That David played, and he pleased the Lord 
    C                D               G       D
But you don't really care for music, do you? 
         G                   C           D
Well, it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth 
    Em                 C
The minor fall and the major lift 
    D               Bm          Em
The baffled king composing hallelujah 
     C           Em
Hallelujah, hallelujah
     C           G  D G
Hallelujah, hallelu-u-jah 

          G                         Em
Well your faith was strong, but you needed proof 
    G               Em
You saw her bathing on the roof 
    C             D             G         D
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you 
        G               C       D
And she tied you to her kitchen chair 
        Em                         C
And she broke your throne, and she cut your hair 
    D                  Bm            Em
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah 
     C           Em
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelu-u-jah

Well baby I've been here before

I've seen this room and I've walked this floor

You know, I used to live alone before I knew you

And love is not a victory march

What's really going on below

I remember when I moved in you

But all I've ever learned from love

Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
     Em                 C 
It's not somebody who's seen the light

It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Once a jolly swagman camp'd by a billabong
D         A7         D         A
under the shade of a coolibah tree and he
D          A           Bm              G
sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda,

you'll come a waltzing Matilda with me and he          (chorus)
D        A7         Bm              G
sang as watched and waited till his billy boiled

D            A         Bm           G
Down came a jumbuck to drink at the waterhole
D             A7           D               A
Up Jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee
        D          A           Bm              G
And he sang as he stowed that jumbuck in his tucker bag

You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me


D              A         Bm             G
Down came the Squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred
D            A7          D            A
Down came the troopers, one , two and three
D              A            Bm             G
Whose is that jumbuck you've got in ya tucker-bag?

But the swagman he up and jumped into that water-hole

Drowning himself by the Coolibah tree
        D             A           Bm           G
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by the billabong

Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me?

\chapter{And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda}
\begin{verbatim}
C            F           C          Am
When I was a young man I carried a pack
      C              G7        C
and I lived the free life of a rover.
     C              F            C        Am
From the Murray's green banks to the dusty outback
  C          G7          C
I waltzed my Matilda all over.
        G7                  F             C
Then in nineteen fifteen my country said "son",
        G7                         F          G7
There's no time for rovin' there's work to be done!
         C             F       C          Am
And they gave me a tin hat and gave me a gun
         C       G7          C
And they sent me away to the war.


Chorus

C                   F           C
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
       C           F             Dm
As the ship pulled away from the quay,
G7                  F                C          Am
 and amidst all the cheers, the flag waving and tears,
   C              G7     C
We sailed off for Gallipoli


2.
How well I remember that terrible day
How our blood stained the sand and the water
And how in that hell they called Suvla Bay
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter
Johhny Turk he was waiting, he'd primed himself well
He showered us with bullets, and rained us with shell,
And in five minutes flat, he'd blown us to hell
Nearly blew us right back to Australia

And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda
As we stopped to bury the slain
We buried ours and the Turks buried theirs,
Then we started all over again

3.
They collected the crippled, the wounded and maimed
And they shipped us back home to Australia
The armless the legless, the blind and insane,
All the brave heroes of Suvla
And when our ship pulled in to Circular Quay,
I looked at the place where my legs used to be,
And thanked Christ there was nobody waiting for me -
To grieve, to mourn and to pity.

And the band played Waltzing Matilda,
As they carried us down the gangway,
But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared -
And they turned all their faces away.

4.
And so now every April I sit on my porch,
And I watch the parade pass before me,
And I see my old comrades how proudly they march,
Reviving old dreams and past glories,
But the old men march slowly their bones stiff and sore,
Tired old men from a tired old war,
And the young people ask what are they marching for,
And I ask myself the same question.

But the band played Waltzing Matilda
And the old men still answer the call,
But year by year more old men disappear
Soon no one will march there at all.

C                 F         
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda,
C             F          C           G
you'll come a waltzing Matilda with me and he
C        G7         Am              F
sang as watched and waited till his billy boiled
C                       G7          C
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Bows and flows of angel hair
      C          Bm     Em     G
And ice cream castles in the air
              C        Am
And feather canyons everywhere

I've looked at clouds that way

   It's clouds' illusions I recall

   I really don't know clouds    at all

Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy, dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave them laughing as you go
And if you care don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

   I've looked at love from both sides now
   From give and take, and still somehow
   It's love's illusions I recall
   I really don't know love at all
\end{verbatim}

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say, "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Something's lost and something's gained
In living every day

   I've looked at life from both sides now
   From win and lose, and still somehow
   It's life's illusions I recall
   I really don't know life at all

Ah, but what the hell, You know it's just as well

    C                        G/B     C                D 
I'd like to spend a day or two, but I can't stay that long

No, I've got to meet expenses, I got to stay in line

Gotta get those fees to the agencies

And I'd love to stay but there's bills to pay
     D                     G 
So I just don't have the time

  G                     C 
I am the entertainer, I come to do my show
       C                    G/B     C             D
You've heard my latest record, it's been on the radio
       G                                        C
Ah, it took me years to write it, they were the best years of my life
          Cmaj7                 D
It was a beautiful song, but it ran too long
          Am                    C
If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit
        D                 G
So they cut it down to 3:05

G                         C 
I am the entertainer, the idol of my age
  C                     G/B    C           D 
I make all kinds of money when I go on the stage

Ah, you've seen me in the papers, I've been in the magazines
       Cmaj7       D 
But if I go cold I won't get sold
         Am                     C

\chapter{Deeper Well}
\begin{verbatim}
Ebm
The sun burned hot, it burned my eyes 

Burned so hot I thought I'd died 

Thought I'd died and gone to hell 

Lookin' for the water from a deeper well 

I went to the river but the river was dry 

I fell to my knees an I looked to the sky 

I looked to the sky and the spring rain fell 

I saw the water from a deeper well 

Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well

Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 

I was ready for love I was ready for the money 

Ready for the blood and ready for the honey 

Ready for the winnin', ready for the bell 

Lookin' for the water from a deeper well

I found some love and I found some money 

Found that blood would drip from the honey 

Found I had a thirst that I could not quell 

Lookin'for the water from a deeper well 

Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 

Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 

Well I did it for kicks and I did it for faith 

I did it for lust and I did it for hate 

I did it for need and I did it for love 

Addiction stayed on tight like a glove 

So I ran with the moon and I ran with the night 

And the three of us were a terrible sight 

Nipple to the bottle to the gun to the cell 

To the bottom of a hole of a deeper well

Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 

Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 

I rocked with the cradle and I rolled with the rage 

I shook those walls and I rattled that gage 

I took my trouble down a deadend trail 

Reachin' out a hand for a holier grail 

Hey there mama did you carry that load 

Did you tell your baby 'bout the bend in the road

'Bout the rebel yell 'bout the one that fell 

Lookin' for the water from a deeper well 

Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 

Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well

Where the storm has passed over and the sky above is clear
       
I've got lines under my eyes that I've never had before
There's a war outside my window and a wasteland outside my door
And I've been traveling down this road all these days and all these nights
I've been traveling for so long now, I've been searching for the light

We've got pain and we've got sorrow that we've been trying not to feel
We've got trouble all around us and we've got wounds that still won't heal
So let's hold on to each other and let love take us through the night
Help us stumble through the darkness, take us to the morning light

I have lines under my eyes that I didn't have last year
I've got the world's weight on my shoulders but I won't shed another tear
Cause the sun is gonna rise and tomorrow's another day
And we will hold on to each other and we will sing and we will pray
            C  G             D
And we will sing and we will pray
            C  G             D
And we will sing and we will pray

Oh all the money that e'er I spent
I spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas, it was to none but me And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas, it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Oh all the comrades that e'er I've had
Are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I've had
Would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

\chapter{Raggle Taggle Gypsies}
\begin{verbatim}
           Am
There were three auld gypsies came to our hall door.
 Am        G         Em   
They came brave and boldly-o.
    Am                    Em         F
And one sang high and the other sang low
        Am                         G    Am
And the other sang a raggle taggle gypsy-o.
 
It was upstairs, downstairs the lady went,
Put on her suit of leather-o,
And it was the cry all around her door;
"She's away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o"
 
It was late that night when the lord came in,
Enquiring for his lady-o,
And the servant girl's reply to him was;
"She's away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o"
 
"Then saddle for me my milk-white steed
Me big horse is not speedy-o
And I will ride and I'll seek me bride,
She's away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o"
 
He rode east and he rode west
He rode north and south also,
And when he rode to the wide open field
It was there that he spied his lady-o.
 
"Arra, why did you leave your house and your land,
Why did you leave your money-o?
Why did you leave your only wedded lord
All for the raggle taggle gypsy-o?"
 
"Yerra what do I care for me house and me land?
What do I care for money-o?
What do I care for me only wedded lord?
I'm away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o"
 
"It was there last night you'd a goose feather bed,
Blankets drawn so comely-o.
But tonight you lie in a wide open field
In the arms of the raggle taggle gypsy-o"
 
"Yerra, what do I care for me goose feather bed?
Yerra, what do I care for blankets-o?
What do I care for me only wedded lord?
I'm away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o"
 
"Oh, for you rode east when I rode west,
You rode high and I rode low.
I'd rather have a kiss of the yellow gypsy's lips
Than all the cash and money-o"

\chapter{Whiskey in the Jar}
\begin{verbatim}
[C]As I was going over the[Am,] far fam'd Kerry Mountains,
I[F] met with Captain Farrel, and his[C] money he was[G] countin',
I[C] first produced my pistol, and I[Am] than produced my rapier,
Sayin': [F]"Stand and deliver for you[C] are my bold deceiver". 

CHO: Musha[G] ring dum a doo dum a da,
[C]Whack fol de daddy o,
[F]Whack fol de daddy o
There's[C] whiskey[G] in the[C] jar. 

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny,
I put it in my pocket, and I took it home to Jenny,
She sighed, and she swore that she never would deceive me,
But the devil takes the women for they never can be easy.

I went into my chamber all for to take a slumber,
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder,
But Jenny drew my charges and she filled them out with water,
Then sent for Captain Farrel, to be ready for the slaughter.

'Twas early in the morning just before I rose to travel,
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise, Captain Farrel,
I first produced my pistol for she stole away my rapier,
But I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken.

If anyone can aid me 'tis my brother in the army,
If I can find his station, in Cork or in Killarney,
And if he'll go with me we'll go roving in Kilkenny,
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my darling sporting Jenny.

In the[D] rare ould [G]Times.

My name it is Sean Dempsey
As Dublin as could be
Born hard & late in Pimlico
In a house that ceased to be
My trade I was a cooper
Lost out to redundancy
Like my house that fell to progress
My trades a memory

I courted Peggy Digman
As pretty as you please.
A rage and child of Mary
from the rebel liberties
I lost her to a student chap
With skin as back as coal
When he took her off to Birmingham
She took away my soul.

The years have made me bitter
The gargle dims me brain
Cause Dublin keeps on changing
and Nothing seems the same.
The Pillar and the Met have gone
The Royal long since pulled down
As the grey unyielding concrete
Makes a city of my Town.

Fare thee well sweet Anna Liffey

And watch me new glass cages that
Spring up along me Ouay

Too old to hear new chimes

In the rare ould times.

My mother was a tailor,
She sewed those new blue jeans,
my husbend he's a gambling man,
(drinks) down in New Orleans.

My husbend in a gambler,
He goes from town to town,
The only time, he's satisfied, is when
He drinks his liquor down.

Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done -
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of Rising Sun

One foot on the platform,
The other's on the train,
I'm going back to New Orleans,
to wear that ball and chain.

Going back to New Orleans,
My race is almost run,
I'm going to spend the rest of my life,
Beneath that "Rising Sun".

There are places I'll remember    all my li--ife though some have changed,

        G             Em    G7            C   Cm7     G
Some forever not for better,    some have go--one and some remain.

            Em              C             F                     G
All these places had their moments, with lovers and friends I still can recall,

          Em                A7        Cm7           G                  D
Some are dead and some are living, in my life I've loved them all.


        G                     Em    G7          C  Cm7     G
But of all these friends and lovers,   there is no one compares with you,

           G                   Em     G7          C       Cm7     G
And these memories lose their meaning,   when I think of love as something new.

          Em                     C           F                      G
Though I know I'll never lose affection for people and things that went before,

   Em                              A7           Cm7           G               D
I know I'll often stop and think about them, in my life I'll love you more.

I looked up into the grey sky
and see a thousand eyes staring back
and all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black

I feel a way of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
if vision is the only validation
then most of my life isn't real

'cause if you're not really here
then the stars don't even matter
now I'm filled to the top with fear
but it's all just a bunch of matter
'cause if you're not really here

All our sins and griefs to bear!
 D                   G

Ev'rything to God in prayer!

All because we do not carry
 D     A               D
Ev'rything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged:
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful,
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our ev'ry weakness:
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Jesus only is our refuge:
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there.

He to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood

Oh to grace how great a debtor, Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter, Bind my wandering heart to Thee
Prone to wander, Lord I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, Oh take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above

I know that it is freezing but I think we have to walk 
keep waving at the taxis they keep turning their lights off 
but julie knows a party at some actor's west-side loft
supplies are endless in the evening by the morning they'll be gone

 G | G | C | C | 2x
Am | Am | D | D |
Am | C | Am | D | G |

When everything is lonely I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper have my own conversations
with the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
the mask I polish in the evening by the morning looks like shit


Chorus I: C | C | G | G |
          C | C | G | A7 |
          C | Em | Am | G | C |
          Am | C | Am | D | G |

And I know you have a heavy heart, I can feel it when we kiss 
So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
But me I'm not a gamble you can count on me to split 
The love I sell you in the evening by the morning won't exist

Verse II: G | G | C | C | 2x

         Am | C | Am | D | G |

 
You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
Just keep going to the bathroom always say you'll be right back
Well it takes one to know one kid I think you've got it bad
But whats so easy in the evening by the morning's such a drag




G | G | C | C | 2x
Am | Am | D | D |
Am | C | Am | D | G |


I've got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the train
And if you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the same
Yeah we might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain
But what was normal in the evening by the morning seems insane


Chorus II: C | C | G | G |
          C | C | G | A7 |
          C | Em | Am | G | C|

          Am | C | Am | D | Em
          Am | C | Am | C | Am | C |....G

And I'm not sure what the trouble was that started all of this 
The reasons all have run away but the feeling never did
It's not something I would recommend but it is one way to live
Cause what is simple in the moonlight by the morning never is 
Yeah it was simple in the moonlight now it's so complicated 
It was so simple in the moonlight, so simple in the moonlight, so simple in the moonlight

I'm glad I didn't die before I met you.

Man of Constant Sorrow
Soggy Bottom Boys


Intro: G - C - D - G

             D    C         G
I: (In constant sorrow through his days)

    G                C             D         G
1. I am the man of constant sorrow, I've seen trouble all my days 
2. For six long years, I've been in trouble, No pleasure here on earth I find
3. It's fare-thee-well my own new lover, I never expect to see you again
4. You can bury me in some deep valley, Or any hill where I may lay
5. Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger, My face you'll never see no more

    G                C                 D               G 
1. I bid farewell to old Kentucky, The place where I was born and raised
2. For in this world, I'm bound to ramble, I have no friends to help me now

Seasons spinning round again, the years keep rolling by


Seems like I've been here before, I can't remember when
But I've got this funny feeling, that we'll all get together again
There's no straight lines make up my life, all the roads have bends
There's no clear cut beginning, and sometimes no clear end


I've found you a thousand times, I guess you've done the same
But then we lose each other, it's just like a children's game
But as I find you here again, the thought rolls through my mind
Our love is like a circle, let's go 'round one more time.

\chapter{Walking}
by the Dodos
\begin{verbatim}
You can fight the fire that's in your head
Lay it down, the hour has come to end
Walk around without her just for a bit
Looking back upon the way things had been

Man, I've been wasting so much time
Walking the same street every night
Don't you think maybe it's about time?

You can light the fire that's in your head
Put it off, tomorrow will come instead
We don't watch the tower that tells us when
Pull the wicked flower out from its bed

Man's been wasting so much time
Sending the children out to fight
Don't you think maybe it's about time?

\chapter{Different Names for the Same Thing}
Deathcab for Cutie
\begin{verbatim}
this song is originally played on piano and there is a synth part in the middle that I 
transcribe.  D augmented is a D with a high Bb on piano.

D           Daugmented     G/D     D/F#
Alone on a train aimless in wonder
An outdated map crumbled in my pocket
But I didn't care where I was going
             Bm       F#m          Gmaj7       D
'Cause they're all different names for the same place.

The coast disappeared when the sea drowned the sun
And I knew no words to share with anyone
The boundaries of language I quietly cursed
And all the different names for the same thing

Bm      F#m           Gmaj7        D
There are different names for the same things
There are different names for the same things...

Cause in my head there’s a greyhound station
Am                          C
Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
Am                           C
So they may have a chance of finding a place
              G
where they’re far more suited than here


Am   C            G
I do believe it’s true
               Am            C           G
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
       Am            C
If the silence takes you
       G
Then I hope it takes me too


   Am           C        G
So brown eyes I hold you near
                 Am          C       G
Cause you’re the only song I want to hear
       Am       C       G
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

I'd bring it to where you are

Making a lake of the East River and Hudson

\begin{verbatim}

Rocky Mountain High (John Denver)
#A much simpler version, a sort of a camp-fire version of it, and easy to sing 
along with as well, which works best for me. A friend of mine used to play like 
this, I just tabbed it#


       G                         C    D
He was born in the summer of his 27th year,
       G                          C
Comin' home to a place he'd never been before.
        G           Em                  C                D
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again,
          G                            C
You might say he found a key for every door.

        G                              C             D
When he first came to the mountain his life was far away,
       G                     C
On the road and hangin' by a song,
        G                Em            C              D
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care,
         G                                   C
It keeps changin' fast and it don't last for long.

        C        D              G          C               D           G
But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky.
    C               D            G                  C
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullaby.
               G         C                    G         C
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado.

   G                                   C               D
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below,
       G                            C
He saw everything as far as you can see.
         G               Em                C                  D
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun,
       G                               C
And he lost a friend, but kept his memory.




G                                  C               D
Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams,
        G                      C
Seeking grace in every step he takes.
    G                  Em              C            D
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
    G                                 C
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake.

        C        D              G          C               D           G
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky.
        C               D             G        C
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply.
               G         C                    G         C
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado.

        G                               C                     D
Now his life is full of wonder, but his heart still know some fear
     G                            C
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend.
         G               Em               C                 D
Why they try to tear the mountain down to bring in a couple more,
     G                           C
More people, more scars upon the land.

        C        D              G          C               D           G
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky.
  C              D                G                  C
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly.
               G            C        D              G
Rocky Mountain high, it's a Colorado Rocky Mountain high,
     C               D           G    C                 
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky, friends around the
D            G   C
campfire and everybody's high,

               D   G                            My spirit loudly sings,
   My triumph has begun,                        The holy ones, behold they come,
Chorus. . .                                     I hear the noise of wings,

   Oh come angel band,

   Come and around me stand,

   Bear me away on your snow white wings,

            D      G
   To my immortal home,

   Bear me away on your snow white wings,

G 
The fox went out on a chilly night 
                          D 
He prayed for the moon to give him light 
G                       C 
For heâd many a mile to go that night 
G         D           G       D       G 
Before he reached the town-o, town-o, town-o 
C                   G              D                     G 
Heâd many a mile to go that night, before he reached the town-o 
 
 
G 
He ran til he came to the farmer's pen 
                             D 
The ducks and the geese were kept therein 
G                                   C 
He said, "a couple of you are gonna grease my chin, 
G        D          G       D       G 
Before I leave this town-o, town-o, town-o"
C                              G              D                    G 
Said a couple of you are gonna grease my chin, before I leave this town-o 
 
 
G 
He grabbed the great goose by the neck 
                    D 
And he threw a duck across his back 
G                      C 
And he didnât mind the quack, quack 
G                D        G       D       G 
And the legs all dangling down-o, down-o, down-o 
C                     G                    D                 G 
He didnât mind the quack, quack and the legs all dangling down-o 
 
 
 
 
G 
The old grey woman jumped out of bed 
                      D 
Out of the window she popped her head, 
G                            C 
Crying John, John, the great goose is gone 
G              D      G       D       G 
And the fox is on the town-o, town-o, town-o 
C                     G                     D             G 
John, John, the great goose is gone and the fox is on the town-o 
 
 
G 
He ran til he came to his nice warm den 
                                D 
And there were the little ones, eight, nine, ten 
G                          C 
Sayin Daddy, Daddy, better go back again 
G                D          G       D       G 
For it must be a might fine town-o, town-o, town-o 
C             G                    D                   G 
Daddy, Daddy, go back again for it must be mighty fine town-o 
 
 
G 
The fox and his wife, without any strife 
                        D 
Cut up the goose with a fork and a knife 
G                     C 
They never had such a supper in their life 
G                   D             G        D        G 
And the little ones chewed on the bones-o, bones-o, bones-o 
C                     G 
They never had such a supper in their life 
        D                         G 
And the little ones chewed on the bones

what will be left when I've drawn my last breath,
  Am                   F                     G       G
besides the folks I've met and the folks who know me,
C         F        C           F 
will I discover a soul saving love, (or)
  Am              F          G       G
or just the dirt above and below me,


       F       C 
I'm a doubting thomas,
F            C 
   I took a promise,
F           G        C     Cadd9
   but I do not feel safe,
Am          G       F C, F C, F G C (like intro) 
   oh me of little faith,


C           F          C           F
sometimes I pray for a slap in the face,
       Am        F                   G 
then I beg to be spared 'cause I'm a coward,
             C         F                   C           F
if there's a master of death I'll bet he's holding his breath,
              Am                 F              G
as I show the blind and tell the deaf about his power,


      F        C
I'm a doubting thomas,
F                  C
   I can't keep my promises,

   'cause I don't know what's safe,
Am          G       F C, F C, F G 
   oh me of little faith

(BRIDGE)
Ab
can I be used to help others find truth,

\chapter{Green and Grey}
\begin{verbatim}
Verse1:
A                                                        C#m
I'm in a room full of people all hanging on one person's breath.
G                                                Bm
We would all vote him most likely to be loved to death,
      A                                                  C#m
And I hope he still wants it, but it might remind him of when
    G                                                   A
He aimed for the bulls eye and hit it nine times out of ten.

Verse2:
Then one time his hand slipped and I saw the dart sail away.
I don't know where it landed but I'm guessing between green and gray.
I thought nothing of it, but it still haunts him like a ghost.
With all eyes upon him except two that matter the most, he says:

CHORUS:
A     B/A    B          D        F#m  D          E
Green is the color that everyone sees all around me
A     B/A    B       D          F#m      E            A 
Gray  is the color I see around her, but she's just a blur
    D              C#m        Bm         A         
The more the crowd cheers the less I can hear 
         F#m                      C#
And they don't really care what I play
D            C#m          Bm          E              A
Might be for her, but for now it's between green and gray.

                  Am             C
It's empty in the valley of your heart
                  Am            C
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
                  Am
Away from all the fears
            C             G    C       
And all the faults you've left behind


                    Am              C
The harvest left no food for you to eat
                  Am              C
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
                    Am
But I have seen the same
           C        G    C
I know the shame in your defeat


    C      F       C  
But I will hold on hope
    C       F       C  
And I won't let you choke
F            C           G
On the noose around your neck


    Am        F           C
And I'll find strength in pain
    Am     F         C
And I will change my ways
F            C                   G
I'll know my name as it's called again






             Am                      C 
Cause I have other things to fill my time
                 Am                  C
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
                  Am
Now let me at the truth
           Am         G      C
Which will refresh my broken mind


               Am                C 
So tie me to a post and block my ears
          Am                            C 
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
                          Am
I know my call despite my faults
    C          G       C 
And despite my growing fears


    C      F       C  
But I will hold on hope

And I'll find strength in pain
    Am     F         C
And I will change my ways
F            C                   G
I'll know my name as it's called again


                    Am                   C 
So come out of your cave walking on your hands
                  Am             C 
And see the world hanging upside down
                   Am
You can understand dependence
         C        G       C 
When you know the maker's hand


   C         F       C  
So make your siren's call
    C    F       C  
And sing all you want
  F        C             G
I will not hear what you have to say


      Am     F       C  
Cause I need freedom now
   Am F            C  
And I need to know how
   F       C            G 
To live my life as it's meant to be


    C      F       C  
But I will hold on hope
    C       F       C  
And I won't let you choke
F            C           G
On the noose around your neck


    Am        F           C
And I'll find strength in pain
    Am     F         C
And I will change my ways

INTRO:

  C    G    Am     F (x2)


VERSE 1:

        C     G            Am                 F
As the winter winds litter London with lonely hearts
        C             G              Am         F
Oh the warmth in your eyes swept me into your arms
        C                    G           Am             F
Was it love or fear of the cold that led us through the night?
    C               G                 Am         F
For every kiss your beauty trumped my doubt


CHORUS:

       F            C
And my head told my heart
 F    C    G  
"Let love grow"
       F             C
But my heart told my head
  F    C   G                 C
"This time no, this time no..."


VERSE 2:

           C        G          Am     F
We'll be washed and buried one day my girl
         C          G              Am             F
And the time we were given will be left for the world
     C                    G            Am          F
The flesh that lived and loved will be eaten by plague
    C                  G         Am        F
So let the memories be good for those who stay... hey!





CHORUS:
       F            C
And my head told my heart
 F    C    G  
"Let love grow"
       F             C
But my heart told my head
  F    C   G                 C
"This time no, this time no..."



VERSE 3:  (Strum chords only once)

       C                  G            Am              F
Oh the shame that sent me off from the God that I once loved
        C          G       Am       F
Was the same that sent me into your arms
       C             G                Am            F
Oh and pestilence is won when you are lost and I am gone
       C        G         Am    F
And no hope, no hope will overcome


(Bring back to normal strumming)
            C      G          Am    F
And if your strife strikes at your sleep
           C     G      Am        F
Remember spring swaps snow for leaves
  C        G          Am       F
You'll be happy and wholesome again
         C     G         Am     F
When the city clears and sun ascends... hey!

\chapter{On the Radio}
\begin{verbatim}
FIRST VERSE
C
This is how it works
G
It feels a little worse
Am
Than when we drove our hearse
F
Right through that screaming crowd

While laughing up a storm
Until we were just bone
Until it got so warm
That none of us could sleep

And all the styrofoam
Began to melt away
We tried to find some words
To aid in the decay

But none of them were home
Inside their catacomb
A million ancient bees
Began to sting our knees

While we were on our knees
Praying that disease
Would leave the ones we love
And never come again

REFRAIN
C
On the radio
G
We heard November Rain
Am
That solo's really long (awful long)
F
But it's a pretty song (a good refrain)

C
We listened to it twice
G
'Cause the DJ was asleep

SECOND VERSE
This is how it works
You're young until you're not
You love until you don't
You try until you can't

You laugh until you cry
You cry until you laugh
And everyone must breathe
Until their dying breath

No, this is how it works
You peer inside yourself
You take the things you like
And try to love the things you took

And then you take that love you made
And stick it into some
Someone else's heart
Pumping someone else's blood

And walking arm in arm
You hope it don't get harmed
But even if it does
You'll just do it all again

\chapter{The Call}
\begin{verbatim}
  G                D
It started out as a feeling
           Em          C
Which then grew into a hope
           G             D
Which then turned into a quiet thought
           Em                  C
Which then turned into a quiet word
    D                   D7
And then that word grew louder and louder
 G                   Em
'Til it was a battle cry
          C
I'll come back
         D    Em
When you call me
G                  D
No need to say goodbye

G                         D
Just because everything's changing
                  Em                    C
Doesn't mean it's never been this way before
G                        D
All you can do is try to know who your friends are
   Em                  C
As you head off to the war
D                  D7
Pick a star on the dark horizon
    G          Em
And follow the light
            C
You'll come back 
          D Em
When it's over
G          D       Em
No need to say goodbye
            C            
You'll come back 
          D Em
When it's over
G          D       G
No need to say goodbye

G                       D
Now we're back to the beginning
            Em                       C
It's just a feeling and no one knows yet
    G                       D
But just because they can't feel it too
        Em                       C
Doesn't mean that you have to forget
D                      D7
Let your memories grow stronger and stronger
G                        Em
'Til they're before your eyes
            C
You'll come back
          D    Em
When they call you
G          D       Em
No need to say goodbye
            C
You'll come back
          D    Em
When they call you
G          D       G
No need to say goodbye

Someone’s deciding whether or not to steal

He opens the window just to feel the chill 
             Am     G        C                F
He hears that outside a small boy just starting to cry 
                 Am         G                     C
‘Cause it’s his turn but his brother won’t let him try  

Am       G          C               F

VERSE 4

     G
I went back home, my home was lonesome
     C                G
Miss my mother she was gone.

All my brothers, and sisters crying

What a home so sad and lone.

We sang the songs of childhood.

Hymns of faith that made us strong.

Ones that Mother Maybelle taught us
     G        D       G
And the angels sang along.

\chapter{Pretty Polly}
\begin{verbatim}
Chords are just G, D, G

4
Oh Polly, Pretty Polly, would you take me unkind
Polly, Pretty Polly, would you take me unkind
Let me set beside you and tell you my mind

Well my mind is to marry and never to part
My mind is to marry and never to part
The first time I saw you it wounded my heart

Oh Polly Pretty Polly come go along with me
Polly Pretty Polly come go along with me
Before we get married some pleasures to see

Oh he led her over mountains and valleys so deep
He led her over hills and valleys so deep
Pretty Polly mistrusted and then began to weep

Oh Willie, Little Willie, I'm afraid to of your ways
Willie, Little Willie, I'm afraid of your ways
The way you've been rambling you'll lead me astray

Oh Polly, Pretty Polly, your guess is about right
Polly, Pretty Polly, your guess is about right
I dug on your grave the biggest part of last night

Oh she knelt down before him a pleading for her life
She knelt down before him a pleading for her life
Let me be a single girl if I can't be your wife

Oh Polly, Pretty Polly that never can be
Polly, Pretty Polly that never can be
Your past reputation's been trouble to me

He opened up her busom, as white as any snow.
He opened up her busom, as white as any snow.
He stabbed her through the heart,
and the blood did overflow.

Oh went down to the jailhouse and what did he say
He went down to the jailhouse and what did he say
I've killed Pretty Polly and trying to get away

Green rolling hills
Emmylou Harris
    C                   G               C
    The green rolling   hills of West   Virginia
        F                               G
Are the nearest thing to heaven that I  know
        C
Tho the times are sad and drear
        F
And I   cannot linger here
            C           G           C
They'll     keep me and never let me go
    C                   G           C
    My daddy said don't ever be a   miner
        F                                 G
For a   miner's grave is all you'll ever own
            C
'Cause the  hard times everywhere
    F
I   can't find a dime to spare

    So I'll move away in to some crowded city
            F                                   G
In some     northern factory town you'll find me there

I'll    never change my mind

\chapter{Yuba City}
\begin{verbatim}
G                   D
I came into Yuba as soon as I read
D                           G
Of all of those twenty-five hobos found dead,
G                        C
I came in to find out if one of the slain
G                       D           G
Could have answered to my brother's name.
G                           D
It might be your brother, I just couldn't say,
D                           G
We hire lots of floaters who work by the day;
G                        C
Now I see his photo they might be the same,
G                   D       G
But I never did ask him his name.
G                             D
If I had a list and if I only knew,
D                                           G
I'd write down their names and sing them to you,
G                                   C
And when I got done, I'd sing them again,
G                       D         G
So you'd all know each one had a name.

He had a room and ran out on the rent,
Hired on a crew, I don't know where he went,
If I knew his boss, I might make a claim,
But I never did write down his name.

He stopped for a drink every now and again,
Didn't look no different than hundreds of men;
You know these old bums, they all look the same,
No reason to ask him his name.

It might have been Shorty, a feller I knew,
We bunked in the empties when the season was through.
You know, I been thinking, it sure is a shame
I never did ask him his name.

We always abandon the old for the new,
And second-hand people get thrown away, too;
I know it won't help, but still it explains
Why no one remembers their names.

Chorus:

At the foot of the hill there's a neat little still, where the smoke curls up the sky
By a whiff of the smell you can plainly tell, there's a poitin still close by
Oh it fills the air with a perfume rare and betwixt both me and you
As home we roll, we can drink a bowl or a bucket of Mountain Dew
Chorus:

Now learned men who use the pen have wrote the praises high
Of the sweet poitin from Ireland green, destilled from wheat and rye
Away with pills, it will cure all ills of the Pagan, Christian or Jew
So take off your coat and grease your throat with the real old Mountain Dew

But now I stand on honest ground, on honest ground

You want to fight for this love

But honey you cannot wrestle a dove
            C
So baby it's clear


Am          C
You want to jump and dance
       F
But you sat on your hands

And lost your only chance
Am          C
Go back to your hometown

Get your feet on the ground

And stop floating around

Summer in the city means cleavage cleavage cleavage
C                              G
And I start to miss you, baby, sometimes          
          C              G              C         F
I've been staying up and drinking in a late night establishment
C                 G
Telling strangers personal things

C                          F
Summer in the city, I'm so lonely lonely lonely
C                                             G
So I went to a protest just to rub up against strangers
      C             G            C              F
And I did feel like coming but I also felt like crying
C                           G
It doesn't seem so worth it right now

F                                          C
And the castrated ones stand in the corner smoking
F                                     C              G
They want to feel the bulges in their pants start to rise
        C        G               C         F
At the site of a beautiful woman they feel nothing but
C                                            G
Anger, her skin makes them sick in the night nauseaous, nauseaous, nauseaous

C                          F
Summer in the city, I'm so lonely lonely lonely
            C                                             G
I've been hallucinating you, babe, at the backs of other women
      C            G               C             F
And I tap on their shoulder and they turn around smiling
           C                       G
But there's no recognition in their eyes








C                           F      
Oh summer in the city means cleavage cleavage cleavage
C                                                        G
And don't get me wrong, dear, in general I'm doing quite fine

It's just when it's summer in the city, and you're so long gone from the city

I start to miss you, baby, sometimes

\chapter{My Little Armalite}
\begin{verbatim}
I was [G] stopped by a soldier he called me a Fenian swine
He [D] hit me with his rifle and he [G] kicked me in the [D] groin
I [G] begged and [C] pleaded told him [G] that I wouldn`t [D] fight
But sure [G] all that I could [Em] think of was my [D] little arma[G]lite

[chorus]
And it`s down in the Bogside that`s where I want to be
Lying in the dark with a Provo company
A comrade on my left and another one on my right
And a clip of ammunition for my little armalite

Well a brave RUC man came walking down our street
Six hundred British soldiers he had lined up at his feet
Come out you cowardly Fenians come on out and fight
But he cried I`m only joking when he heard our armalites

And its up along the Falls Road...

Now the Brits came to visit me twas in the early hours
With Saracens and Saladans and great big armoured cars
They thought they had me covered but I gave them all a fright
With the armour-piercing bullets from my little armalite

And it`s down in the New Lodge...

When big Harry came to Belfast he said the battles won
The generals had all told them that we were on the run
Their coorporals and privates went on patrol one night
They cried send home for reinforcements its those bloody armalites

And it`s out in Crossmaglen...

And it`s down in old Andy` town...

\chapter{Old Joe Clark}
Chords are G and F, listen for the changes.
\begin{verbatim}
Old Joe Clark's a fine old man
Tell you the reason why
He keeps good likker 'round his house
Good old Rock and Rye

Chrous:
Fare ye well, Old Joe Clark
Fare ye well, I say
Fare ye well, Old Joe Clark
I'm a going away

Round and Round, Old Joe Clark
Round and Round I say
I've come about ten thousand miles
to hear your banjo play

Old Joe Clark, the preacher's son
Preached all over the pain
The only text he ever knew
Was High, low, Jack and the game

Old Joe Clark had a mule
His name was Morgan Brown
And every tooth in that mule's head
Was sixteen inches around

Old Joe Clark had ayellow cat
She would neither sing or pray
She stuck her head in the butermilk jar
And washed her sins away

Old Joe Clark had a house
Fifteen stories high
And every story in that house
Was filled with chicken pie

I went down to Old Joe's house
He invited me to supper
I stumped my toe on the table leg
And stuck my nose in the butter


Now I wouldn't marry a widder
Tell you the reason why
She'd have so many children
They'd make those biscuits fly

Sixteen horses in my team
The leaders they are blind
And every time the sun goes down
There's a pretty girl on my mind

Eighteen miles of mountain road
And fifteen miles of sand
If ever travel this road again
I'll be a married man

Never Marry and old school teacher
Tell you the reason why
Blow her nose in old corn bread
and call it pumkin pie

when I thougt that you might save me
[G]                                 [C]
from the dark side of the moon
[G]                            [C]
instead we both went walking to the

and the sleeves drag on the ground

and every hour we're working

G     D                   Cadd9
Gray, quiet and tired and mean,
D  			   G
Picking at a worried seam,
  D				 C9
I try to make you mad at me
Em7      D
Over the phone.

G    D                 Cadd9
Red, eyes and fire and signs,
    D                  G
I’m taken by a nursery rhyme,
  D                     Cadd9
I want to make a ray of sunshine,
    Em7            D
And never leave me home.

CHORUS:
Cadd9		     D
No amount of coffee, no amount of crying,
G			    Em7
No amount of whiskey, no amount of wine,
A               Cadd9
No, no, no, no, no.
Bm      Em        A
Nothing else will do, I gotta have you
C D          G
I gotta have you

BRIDGE:
Em7          D
The road gets cold,
           Cadd9         D
There’s no spring in the middle this year,
Em7          D           Cadd9        D
And I’m the new chicken clucking open hearts and ears.
Em7        D
Oh, such a prima donna,
Cadd9     D
Sorry for myself.
Em7             D
But green, it’s also summer,
Cadd9          A              Em          D   Dsus4 D
And I won’t be warm until I’m laying in your arms.

G            D                       Cadd9
    I see it all through a telescope,
            D                G
Guitar, suitcase, and a warm coat,
D                   Cadd9
Lying the back of a blue boat,
D
Humming a tune...

Thunder rumbles in the distance, a quiet intensity

Sometimes rain that’s needed falls
G                 D4          C9                  D4
We float like two lovers in a painting by Chagall
D4            G                 D4
All around is sky and blue town
D4            C9                         D4
Holding these flowers for a wedding gown

Of people like us, wakeful dreamers. I pass them on the sunlit streets

Still everybody says that if they had the chance they’d fly      like we do.

Capo 3rd fret

D                         G            D
It's the second September I have known you
                      Bm
Four years or so ago, I rode a pony, called him "Truth" 
A                            Bm           A            D
We didn`t know the way so it took us till today to get here

Bm                   G
And all that time, I felt just fine
Bm                          A
I held so many people in my suitcase heart
Bm
I was glad to let the whole thing go 
G
It was taken by the wind and snow
Bm                                 A
And I still didn't know that I was waiting 
G               A         D         G D
For a girl on a slow pony home 

I can remember when I first saw you
You said in my photograph I looked more far away
I laughed and smiled and didn't say "I am a bit afraid to be here." 

And all that time, I felt just fine
I held so many people in my suitcase heart
That I had to let the whole thing go 
It was taken by the wind and snow
And I still didn't know that I was waiting 
For a girl on a slow pony home 

G                           Bm
Setting free the anchor and looking past the shore
G                       E                                  A
It's a sea of horses on ships with no sails, no motors, no oars

Now we're cleaning the windows between us two 
Funny, you do it once, and then again, and pretty soon 
the fingerprints and dust... but I've begun to trust the view here.



And all that time, I felt just fine
I held so many people in my suitcase heart
I was glad to let the whole thing go 
It was taken by the wind and snow
And I still didn't know that I was waiting 
For a girl on a slow pony home

\chapter{Someone Great}
Really should be finger picked, if I can figure a way.
Chords that kinda work are:\\
G, Dm/G, F, C \\
For Dm/G, maybe leave off the finger on string 3,
and use the cheater C chord. \\
Another option: \\
D, A, B, C, G
\begin{verbatim}
 wish that we could talk about it,
But there, that's the problem.
With someone new I couldn't start it,
Too late, for beginnings.
The little things that made me nervous,
Are gone, in a moment.
I miss the way we used to argue,
Locked, in your basement.

I wake up and the phone is ringing,
Surprised, as it's early.
And that should be the perfect warning,
That something's, a problem.
To tell the truth I saw it coming,
The way, you were breathing.
But nothing can prepare you for it,
The voice, on the other, end.

The worst is all the lovely weather,
I'm stunned, it's not raining.
The coffee isn't even bitter,
Because, what's the difference?
There's all the work that needs to be done,
It's late, for revision.
There's all the time and all the planning,
And songs, to be finished.

And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
Till the day it stops

And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
Till the day it stops

And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
Till the day it stops

And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
Till the day it stops.

I wish that we could talk about it,
But there, that's the problem.
With someone new I could have started,
Too late, for beginnings.
You're smaller than my wife imagined,
Surprised, you were human.
There shouldn't be this ring of silence,
But what, are the options?

When someone great is gone.
When someone great is gone.
When someone great is gone.
When someone great is gone.

When someone great is gone.
When someone great is gone.
When someone great is gone.
When someone great is gone.

We're safe, for the moment.
Saved,
For the moment.

G
Somewhere high up in the air there
G                    Em          C
I had long forgotten I belong to you
G   
Some unconscious stream of twisted logic
G                           Em                C
Caught me in its whirlwind, left me black and blue

C                             Em
I was senseless, battered and defenseless
            G                          D
Rain became relentless, leaving barren skies
C                        Em
I was broken, all I left unspoken
                  G     D            G
Left me torn wide open, barely still alive

Found your letter sealed away in storage
Under my pretenses, buried out of view
I recalled it hidden in a notebook
Tattered, ruffled pages old but good as new

I was listless, how could I have missed this?
If you are the groundswell, I'm tossed in your tide
I was certain if I'd seen it comin'
I'd have started running back at the starting line

Well I faltered, left you at the altar
Offering my apologies and my gratitude
Now there's a sinking feeling in my chest
You're gonna love me less when I return to you

But you were never one to keep a record
One to hold against me all I failed to prove
I've been tethered, floating like a feather
Anxious in my roaming, stranded on the move

But you're bringing me down


New York, you're safer
And you're wasting my time

Our records all show
You are filthy but fine

But they shuttered your stores
When you opened the doors
To the cops who were bored
Once they'd run out of crime

New York, you're perfect
Don't please don't change a thing

Your mild billionaire mayor's
Now convinced he's a king

So the boring collect
I mean all disrespect

In the neighborhood bars
I'd once dreamt I would drink

New York, I Love You
But you're freaking me out

There's a ton of the twist
But we're fresh out of shout

Like a death in the hall
That you hear through your wall

New York, I Love You
But you're freaking me out

New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

Like a death of the heart
Jesus, where do I start?

But you're still the one pool
Where I'd happily drown

And oh.. Take me off your mailing list
For kids that think it still exists
Yes, for those who think it still exists

Maybe I'm wrong
And maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And maybe you're right

Maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And just maybe you're right

And Oh..
Maybe mother told you true
And they're always be something there for you
And you'll never be alone

But maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And just maybe she's wrong

Maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And if so, is there?

\chapter{Sprawl II (Mountains beyond Mountains)}
personally i think it sounds better with a capo on the first and you play it D,Bm,G instead of C,Am,F. and then during the break its F,Dm,F,A instead of D\#,Cm,D\#,G.
\begin{verbatim}
Capo 3
Intro: C

C                                         Am
They heard me singing and they told me to stop
                                  F              C
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
                                     Am
These days my life, I feel it has no purpose
                               F           C
But late at night the feelings swim to the surface

                                      Am
'Cause on the surface the city lights shine
                                F         C
They're calling at me, come and find your kind
                                     Am
Sometimes I wonder if the World's so small
                       F            C
That we can never get away from the sprawl


Chorus:
F             C
Living in the sprawl
F             C               F                C          C/B
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
               Am
And there's no end in sight
                             F              C
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights

C                                Am
We rode our bikes to the nearest park
                         F             C
Sat under the swings and kissed in the dark
                                   Am
We shield our eyes from the police lights
                    F          C
We run away, but we don't know why

                                    Am
On the black river, the city lights shine
                                  F         C
They're screaming at us, we don't need your kind
                                     Am
Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small
                       F            C
That we can never get away from the sprawl


Chorus

D# Cm D# G

C                                         Am
They heard me singing and they told me to stop
                                  F              C
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
                                     Am
Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small
                 F            C
Can we ever get away from the sprawl?


Chorus


C Am

                             F              C
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights

\chapter{Helplessness Blues}
Drop C tuning, play G like an Em in standard tuning,
in final section, you can do the slick thing where you move two fingers up
the last two string like: \\
12, 33, 55, 67 :-)
\begin{verbatim}
Verse 1:

C
I was raised up believing
      F
I was somehow unique
       G
Like a snowflake distinct among snowflakes
   F                       C
Unique in each way you can see

Verse 2:
C
And now after some thinking
    F
I'd say I'd rather be
  G
A functioning cog in some great machinery
 F                       C
Serving something beyond me

Chorus:

C                                        F
But I don't, I don't know what that will be
         C                       F         C
I'll get back to you someday soon you will see


Verse 3:

C
What's my name, what's my station
        F
Oh just tell me what I should do
        G
I don't need to be kind to the armies of night
           F                    C
That would do such injustice to you

Verse 4: 
C
Or bow down and be grateful
         F
And say "Sure take all that you see"
       G
To the men who move only in dimly-lit halls
       F                    C
And determine my future for me

Chorus:
C                                     F
And I don't, I don't know who to believe
         C                     F           C
I'll get back to you someday soon you will see

Verse 6: 

C
If I know only one thing
          F
It's that every thing that I see
       G
Of the world outside is so inconceivable
F                  C
Often I barely can speak

Yeah I'm tongue tied and dizzy
      F                    
And I can't keep it to myself
      G                             
What good is it to sing helplessness blues?
           F                 C
Why should I wait for anyone else?

Chorus
C                                          F
And I know, I know you will keep me on the shelf
          C                    F       C
I'll come back to you someday soon myself

Short Instrumental: E



Choral Section:

C           F
If I had an orchard
    C             F    (Fadd9)
I'd work till I'm raw
F6          C
If i had an orchard
                  F      Fsus4   F
I'd work till I'm sore

    C              F
And you would wait tables
    C            F    Fsus4   F
And soon run the store

C                 F
Gold hair in the sunlight
   C            F    (Fadd9)
My light in the dawn
F6          C
If I had an orchard
                  F    Fsus4    F
I'd work till I'm sore

   C       F
If I had an orchard

I'd work till I'm sore

Harmony Verse - follow same chord pattern as before...

Someday I'll be
        C               F
Like the man on the screen

\chapter{Grass Stain}
\begin{verbatim}
Intro
D5    A5    G5

D5    A5    G5
I don't care.
D5    A5    G5
I'll embrace all of my vices,
D5    A5    G5
and I will black it out,
D5    A5    G5
or at least slow everything down.
E5                 G5
And I'll fish for compliments
E5                 G5
and I'll drink until I'm happy
E5                 G5             A5
and I'll wonder what you're doing but I won't call.


Our paths split
It's morning but I still feel it
And we skate around
Why our intemperance feels so profound
And I let you in real slow
And I regret it immediately
And I run away so fast
You fall too deep too easily


I don't care If I'm too young to be unhappy
Or I recklessly impair
This newfangled proclivity
And I won't answer my phone
And I'll never leave my bedroom
And I'll avoid you like the plague
Because I can't give you what you want
I won't give you what you want

Capo on 3rd Fret 

Em7		Cadd9 
From the top of the flight 
Em7		Cadd9 
Of the wide white stairs 
Em7		Cadd9 
Through the rest of my life 
Em7		Cadd9 
Do you wait for me there? 

Em7		Cadd9 
There's a bell in my ears 
Em7		Cadd9 
There's the wide white roar 
Em7		Cadd9 
Drop a bell down the stairs 
Em7		Cadd9 
Hear it fall forever more 
Em7		Cadd9 
Hear it fall forevermore 

G/D		Em7 

G/D		Em7 
Drop a bell off of the dock 
G/D		Em7 
Blot it out in the sea 
G/D		Em7 
Drowning mute as a rock 
G/D		Em7 
sounding mutiny 

G/D			 
There's a light in the wings, hits this system of strings, 
                            Em7 
from the side while they swing; 
See the wires, the wires, the wires. 

G/D	 
And the articulation in our elbows and knees 
Em7 
Makes us buckle and we couple in endless increase  
As the audience admires  

G/D  
And the little white dove 
Made with love, made with love 
Em7 
Made with glue and a glove and some pliers 

G/D  
Swings a low sickle arc from its perch in the dark 
Em7 
Settle down, settle down my desire 

D 
And the moment I slept 
C			G 
I was swept up in a terrible tremor 
D				C 
Though no longer bereft, how I shook 
                 Em7 
And i couldn't remember 
D 
And then the furthermost shake 
Am 
Drove a murdering stake in 
C		Em7		G 
And cleft me right down through my center 
D 
And I shouldn't say so 
C			Em7 
But I know that it was then or never 

G/D		Em7 
Push me back into a tree 
G/D		Em7 
Bind my buttons with salt 
G/D		Em7 
Fill my long ears with bees 
G/D		 
Braying 'please, please, please, 
		Em7 
Oh you ought not! 
No you ought not!' 




G/D  
And then the system of strings tugs on the tip of my wings 
                             Em7 
Cut from cardboard and old magazines 
Makes me warble and rise like a sparrow. 

G/D  
And in the place where I stood 
There is a circle of wood 
                         Em7 
A quarter to which you chop and you stack in your barrow 

G/D  
And it is terribly good 
To carry water and chop wood 
                          Em7 
Streaked with soot, heavy booted and wild-eyed 

G/D  
As I crash through the rafters 
And the ropes and the pulleys trail after 
                                        Em7 
And the holiest, holiest belfry burns sky high 

D 
And then a slow lip of fire 
Cadd9			G	 
Moves across the prairie with precision 
D 					Cadd9 
While somewhere with your pliers and glue 
                                     Em7	 
You make your first incision 
D			Am 
And in a moment of almost unbearable vision 
Cadd9 			Em7			G 
Doubled over with the hunger of lions 
D 
'Hold me close', cooed the dove 
          Cadd9				Em7 
Who was stuffed now with sawdust and diamonds 

Em7 		D   				G 




Asus 	Cadd  	G 
I wanted to say 'why the long face?' 
Asus	     Cadd9			G 
Sparrow perch and play songs of long face 
Asus      Cadd9		G 
Burro buck and bray songs of long face 
                     Am			Cadd9 
Sings 'i will swallow your sadness and eat your cold clay 
G 
Just to lift your long face 
Asus				Cadd9 
And though it may be madness, I will take to the grave 
G 
Your precious long face 
Asus 					Cadd9 
& though our bones they may break & our souls separate 
G 
Why the long face?  
			Asus		Cadd9 
And though our bodies recoil from the grip of the soil 
G 
Why the long face? 

G/D                             Em7 
In the trough of the waves 
G/D                             Em7 
Which are pawing like dogs 
G/D                             Em7 
Pitch we, pale-faced and grave 
G/D                             Em7 
As I write in my log. 
G/D                             Em7 
Then I hear a noise from the hull 
G/D                             Em7 
Seven days out to sea 
G/D                             Em7 
And it is the damnable bell 
G/D                              
And it tolls, I believe, that it tolls 
              Em7 
It tolls for me!         
And it tolls for me! 




G/D                              
And though my wrists and my waist 
Seem so easy to break 
              Em7 
Still my dear I would've walked you to the edge of the water 

G/D                              
And they will recognize all the lines of your face 
              Em7 
In the face of the daughter, of the daughter, of my daughter 

G/D                              
And darling we will be fine 
But what was yours and mine 
Em7 
Appears to be a sandcastle that the gibbering wave takes 

G/D                              
But if it's all just the same 
Then say my name, say my name, 
Em7 
in the morning so that i know when the wave breaks 

D 
I wasn't born of a whistle 
C			G 
Or milked from a thistle at twilight 
D 
No, i was all horns and thorns 
                    C					Em7 
Sprung out fully formed, knock-kneed and upright 
D			Asus 
So enough of this terror we deserve to know light 
C		Em7		G 
And grow evermore lighter and lighter 
D		 
You would have seen me through 
C		Em7 
But I could not undo that desire 

D	C	Em7 
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh desire 
D	C	Em7 
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh desire 
D	C   	Em7 
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh desire  

Em7		Cadd9 
From the top of the flight 
Em7 		Cadd9 
Of the wide white stairs 
Em7 		Cadd9 
Through the rest of my life 
Em7 		Cadd9 
Do you wait for me there?

  When you were young

You were the king of carrot flowers

And how you built a tower tumbling through the trees

In holy rattlesnakes that fell all around your feet

                                     G              F      G
And your dad would throw the garbage all across the floor
                               F                       C

  And this is the room

One afternoon I knew I could love you
                         G              F    G
And from above you how I sank into your soul
                             F              C
Into that secret place where no one dares to go

C                                      G          F        C

                               G                 F   G
And dad would dream of all the different ways to die
                            F               C
Each one a little more than he could dare to try

\begin{verbatim}
The first day I step foot
In this fair country
Boarder man took my paper
Told me I would be free
Boarder man took my paper
Told me I was now free

Walking out into the open air
Well what did I see
Birds flying on a westwind
Sure an omen for me

Opened up my mama’s suitcase
Saw the holes in my shoes
Kicked off (?) soil
Knowing I couldn’t lose
I kicked off that dried up soil
Knowing I couldn’t lose

With my hands down on three jobs
From the morning through the night
Weary eyes don’t see the difference
Tween the dark and the light
Weary eyes don’t see the difference
Tween the dark and the light

10 years later Papa wrote me
Saying Mama had died
Wish that I could see her face now
And the hope in her eyes
Wish that I could see her face now
And the hope in her eyes

I’m just old now, all alone
In a land of fertile lives
I see my unborn born babies
Die of birds in the sky
I see my unborn born babies
Die of birds in the sky


Before I die grant me one thing
Grant one thing to me
Don’t let me dream of nectar
Make me fruit on the tree

Diamond rations, stark white collar
She looks good
He makes the dollars
I'm just free to do what I wanna

I gotta run
Run, run, run
I gotta run

Mama's at ease in socialite graces
Papa remembers the names with the faces
I can speak on the topic of religion
Just can't seem to make a clear decision

I gotta run
Run, run, run
Run to the City of Refuge
I gotta run
I gotta run

Mama's got a lover
Papa thinks he's sober
Pray on my knees, the clouds keep fallin' over
Torn down the lace
Booze on his collar
They never ask if the secret's boiling over
Under white sheets where all I do is wonder

When I'm gonna run
Run, run, run
Run to the City of Refuge
Where everyone is made new
I gotta run
I gotta run

Where there's a mother
Where there's a father
Adam's on the roof and Eve is in the gutter
Eden's on the far side
Where the circle started

To run with the gods, you gotta run harder

Run, run, run
Run to the City of Refuge
Where everyone is made new
Oh the City of Refuge
Where everyone is made new
Oh the City of Refuge

Where our burdens lay in the town
Where we came from

\chapter{All my Little Words}
\begin{verbatim}
Right. Two things.
First, put a Capo on the 1st Fret.
Second, there's a chord used in this song that goes 010220. I have no idea what 
this chord is called, but it sounds right. I saw someone else call it a Em/Cmaj7. 
So if it says that, that's what I mean. 
Now that's out of the way, here are your chords for this amazing song!
                        
VERSE 1:     
                         (G)  (C)  (G)
You are a splendid butterfly
                              (Em)       (Em/Cmaj7)  (Em)
It is your wings that make you beautiful
                     (D)       (C)
And I could make you fly away
                       (G)      (C)  (G)
But I could never make you stay
                        (G)        (C)  (G)
You said you were in love with me
                               (Em)    (Em/Cmaj7) (Em)
Both of us know that that's impossible
                      (D)         (C)       
And I could make you rue the day
                        (G)       (C)  (G)
But I could never make you stay

                       
CHORUS:           
                        (D)   (C)
Not for all the tea in China
                          (G)
Not if I could sing like a bird
                      (D)   (C)    
Not for all North Carolina
                        (G)
Not for all my little words
                         (D)   (C)
Not if I could write for you
                           (G)
The sweetest song you ever heard
                       (D)      (C)
It doesn't matter what I'll do
                      (G)    (C)  (G)
Not for all my little words


VERSE 2 (tablature the same as verse 1)

Now that you've made me want to die
You tell me that you're unboyfriendable
And I could make you pay and pay
But I could never make you stay

  No one can lift the damn thing

  I love it when you read to me and
G C D/F# G
You...
G         C       D/F# G
  You can read me anything


The book of love has music in it
In fact that's where music comes from
Some of it is just transcendental
Some of it is just really dumb but

I...
I love it when you sing to me and
You...
You can sing me anything

The book of love is long and boring
And written very long ago
It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes
And things we're all too young to know but

I...
I love it when you give me things and
You...
You ought to give me wedding rings
I...
I love it when you give me things and
You...
You ought to give me wedding rings

Slip slidin' away, slip slidin' away.   
                        G                      D   
You know the nearer your destination,   
    C                       D          G   
the more you're slip slidin' away.   

  
            Em                               G   
I know a man, he came from my home town.   
                   Em                 D   
He wore his passion for his woman like    
   C                   C7  
a thorny crown.   
              G                     Em   
He said, 'Delores, I live in fear.   
                 G                D   
My love for you is so overpowering,   
     C            D             G   
I'm afraid that I will disappear.'   

Chorus:   

  
              Em                     G   
I know a woman, became a wife.   
                     Em                  D            
These are the very words she uses to   
  C                    C7  
describe her life.   
                   G                            Em   
She said, 'A good day ain't got no rain.'   
                   G                      D   
She said, 'A bad day's when I lie in bed

And I know a fa..ther, who had a son.

He longed to tell him all the reasons for the

things he'd done.   
                 G                      Em   
He came a long way, just to explain.   
                     G                  D   
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping,   
            C                        D                   G   
then he turned around and headed home again.   

Chorus:Add: F C G (2x)  

  
              Em                             G

             Em             D                   C              C7  
The information's unavailable to the mortal man.   
                   G                       Em   
We work our jobs. Collect our pay...   
                   G                       D   
believe we're gliding down the highway   
            C                    D       G

Well I'll turn into a siller cross

But I'll turn into a hydrogen bomb

Well I'll turn into a cockroach
and you'll see if I care...

But I'll turn into a supernova

Well I'll turn into a black little hole

Well I will not believe in you

With all of those little junebugs,
Crawling all around.

Oh my little darling,
You must have come from the trees.
Falling out of them branches,
Falling all over me.

And oh my little darling,
You won't be mine forever.
You weren't made for me.
You were made to be free.

And when we are parted,
Put my body in that water,
So I can sail far away.
I will sail far away.

And when we are parted,
Put my body in the ground,
So all your little junebugs,
Can crawl all around.

Hello my little darling,
You won't be mine forever.
You weren't made for me.
You were made to be free.

And when we are parted.
Put my body in the ground.
So all your little junebugs,
Can crawl all around.

\begin{verbatim}
G                   C            G               Em7
Pale was the wounded knight that bore the rowan shield

G                      D7       Em          C                  D
Loud and cruel were the raven's cries that feasted on the field

        G                  C          G                 Em7
Saying beck water cold and clear will never clean your wound

        G                         D7      Em     C                   D
There's none but the witch of the Westmorland can make thee hale and sound

   G                          C             G                     Em7
So turn, turn your stallion's head til his red mane flies in the wind

        G            D7        Em          C                  D
And the rider of the moon goes by and the bright star falls behind

     G                  C              G                 Em7
And clear was the paley moon when his shadow passed him by

   G                       D7      Em             C               D
Below the hills were the brightest stars when he heard the owlet cry

        G                    C        G                     Em7
Saying "Why do you ride this way, and wherefore came you here?"

    G                    D7       Em     C                     D
"I seek the Witch of the Westmorland who dwells by the winding mere"

         G                  C           G                 Em7
And it's weary by the Ullswater and the misty brake fern way

    G                        D7        Em       C              D
Til through the cleft of the Kirkstone Pass the winding water lay

         G                     C          G                     Em7
He said "Lie down, my brindled hound, and rest ye, my good grey hawk"

    G                    D7       Em         C                 D
And thee, my steed, may graze thy fill for I must dismount and walk

    G                     C        G                 Em7
But come when you hear my horn and answer swift the call

      G                     D7        Em           C                D
For I fear ere the sun will rise this morn ye will serve me best of all."

         G                   C         G              Em7
And it's down to the water's brim he's born the rowan shield

        G            D7       Em    C                       D
And the goldenrod he has cast in to see what the lake might yield

    G                     C         G                   Em7
And wet rose she from the lake, and fast and fleet went she

      G                D7     Em           C                  D
One half the form of a maiden fair with a jet black mare's body

    G                        C            G                Em7
And loud, long and shrill he blew til his steed was by his side

     G            D7        Em       C              D
High overhead the grey hawk flew and swiftly he did ride

    G                         C          G                      Em7
Say "Course well, my brindled hound, and fetch me the jet black mare

G                    D7        Em        C                   D
Stoop and strike, my good grey hawk, and bring me the maiden fair."

          G                         C            G                Em7
She said "Pray, sheathe thy silvery sword.  Lay down thy rowan shield

      G                D7         Em                C              D
For I see by the briny blood that flows you've been wounded in the field"

        G                         C           G                   Em7
And she stood in a gown of velvet blue, bound round with a silver chain

          G                    D7      Em        C                 D
and she's kissed his pale lips one and twice and three times round again

          G                               C         G                   Em7
And she's bound his wounds with the goldenrod, full fast in her arms he lay

    G            D7       Em             C               D
and he has risen hale and sound with the sun high in the day

          G                                C             G                 Em7
She said "Ride with your brindled hound at heel and your good grey hawk in hand

        G                 D7           Em            C                   D
There's none can harm the knight who's lain with the Witch of the Westmorland"

\chapter{This Side of the Blue}
\begin{verbatim}
D
Svetlana sucks lemons across from me
D                     G      A
And I am progressing abominably	
A		G	                        D
And I do not know my own way to the sea
D                G             A          D
But the saltiest sea knows its own way to me

And the city that turns, turns protracted and slow
And I find myself toeing the embarcadero
And I find myself knowing the things that I knew
Which is all that you can know on this side of the blue

And Jaime has eyes black and shiny as boots
And they march at you two-by-two(-re-loo-re-loo)
When she looks at you, you know that she's nowhere near through
It's the kindest heart beating this side of the blue

And Gabriel stands beneath forest and moon
See them rattle and boo, and see them shake, see them loom
See him fashion a cap from a page of Camus
And see him navigate deftly this side of the blue

And the signifieds butt heads with the signifiers
And we all fall down slack-jawed to marvel at words
When across the sky sheet the impossible birds
In a steady illiterate movement homewards

And the rest of our lives will the moments accrue
When the shape of their goneness will flare up anew
Then we do what we have to do(-re-loo-re-loo)
Which is all that you can do on this side of the blue

Ot it's all that you can do on this side of the blue
Oh it's all that you can do on this side of the blue

\chapter{Let's dance to Joy Division}
\begin{verbatim}
G
I'm back in Liverpool,
    Bm               F#   F
And everything seems the same,
                                 C
But I worked something out last night,

That changed this little boy's brain,
G
A small piece of advice,
      Bm                    F#    F
That took twenty-two years in the make,
                             C
And I will break it for you now,
                             C
Please learn from my mistake, please learn from my mistake.


G
Let's dance to Joy Division
D                F#   F
And celebrate the irony,
                      C
Everything is going wrong,
But we're so happy
G
Let's dance to Joy Division,
D                          F#   F
And raise our glass to the ceiling,
                             C
Cause this could all go so wrong,
                             C
But we're just so happy, yeah we're so happy,


Follow the chords for the rest of the song!


So if you're ever feeling down,
Grab your purse and take a taxi
To the darkest side of town
That's where we'll be,
And we will wait for you,
And lead you through the dancefloor,
Up to the DJ booth,
You know what to ask for, you know what to ask for.

Go ask for Joy Division,
And celebrate the irony,
Everything is going wrong
But we're so happy
Go ask for Joy Division,
And raise our glass to the ceiling,
Cause this could all go so wrong,
But we're so happy, so happy,

So let the love tear us apart;
I've found a cure for a broken heart,
Let it tear us apart,
Let the love tear us apart;
I've found a cure for a broken heart,
Let it tear us apart,(Let it tear us apart)
So let the love tear us apart;
I've found a cure for a broken heart,
Let it tear us apart,(Let it tear us apart)
Let the love tear us apart;
I've found a cure for a broken heart,
Let it tear us apart,
Let it tear us apart,
Let it tear us apart.

Let's dance to Joy Division,
And celebrate the irony,
Everything is going wrong
But we're so happy
Let's dance to Joy Division,
And raise our glass to the ceiling,
Cause this could all go so wrong,
But we're so happy, yeah we're so happy,

So happy,
Yeah we're so happy,
So happy,
Yeah we're so happy

Capo VI
with standard tuning

Hi ! This tab is a correct one to play it acoustic with a capo VI, hope it could help you !

It's maybe only my point of view, but I hear on the chorus 
2 pulsations on Am, 1/2 on F, 1/2 on G, and 5 on C, as following :

 _________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                         |

|                   (higher) (lower)             with the  G  optional    |
|_________________________________________________________________________|



C          Em         F         C         
Sleep don't visit, so I choke on sun
        F         C    G
And the days blur into one
        F           C            F             C    G
And the backs of my eyes hum with things I've never done

C         Em                F          C  
Sheets are swaying from an old clothesline
       F      C         G           F        C
Like a row of captured ghosts over old dead grass
          F             C       G
Was never much but we made the most

        Am    F   G    C       
Welcome home
        Am  F  G   C       
Ooooh..                            x2

C           Em       F       C
Ships are launching from my chest
            F         C      G 
Some have names but most do not
         F         C            F         C         G
If you find one, please let me know what piece I've lost


C         Em         F      C
Heal the scars from off my back
         F          C   G
I don't need them any more
         F          C               F       C    G
You can throw them out or keep them in your mason jars

          Am    F   G   C      
I've come home
          Am    F   G   C
Oooooooh                        x2


Bridge : Am    F   G   C     x2

       Am          F       G  C  
All my nightmares escaped my head
        Am                  F    G   C
Bar the door, please don't let them in
         Am      F    G     C  
You were never supposed to leave
       Am                F  G   C 
Now my head's splitting at the seams
    F       C      G
And I don't know if I can     
     

Outro (even if the chords seem strange, try it with the song !) 
NB : use the way to play the chords I've written at the right,
and not those that appears automatically !

C             E              A7
Tom Cruise is so in love with Katie
Dm                              G7
At least all his people tell him so
             C                   E           A7
And while he thinks that she's a very special lady
Dm                                      G7  E
It's probably not the way he'd choose to go
      F           C                   Dm                Am
And a lifetime of longing looks would cause too much distraction
F                      C        G7
Good thing that he's not gay anymore

Chorus
C   E        F          C
Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise crazy
Dm               G7      C     G7
Just be glad it's him not you
C      E       F        C
If you had Tom Cruise's troubles
     Dm                G7    E
You might be Tom Cruise crazy too
      Am                  C7
You'd flash your big white shiny smile
      F             Fm
You'd buy expensive shoes
          C       E  A7
But you'd be the only man on Earth
     Dm       G7      C
Who couldn't enjoy Tom Cruise
   A7     Dm        G7      C (re-intro)
Oh no, you couldn't enjoy Tom Cruise

Verse 2
C             E             A7
Tom Cruise is always getting older
Dm                                G7
He knows he'll never be that young again
    C                     E            A7
And when Tom Cruise looks back over his shoulder
Dm                                G7  E
He sees a thousand younger leading men
   F                   C
He knows someday he'll have to play
   Dm          Am
An old retarded grandpa
      F               C              G7
While someone younger plays his sexy son

Chorus
C   E        F          C
Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise crazy
Dm               G7      C     G7
Just be glad it's him not you
C      E       F        C
If you had Tom Cruise's troubles
     Dm                G7    E
You might be Tom Cruise crazy too
      Am                  C7
You'd flash your big white shiny smile
      F             Fm
You'd buy expensive shoes
          C       E  A7
But you'd be the only man on Earth
     Dm       G7      C
Who couldn't enjoy Tom Cruise
   A7     Dm        G7      C (re-intro)
Oh no, you couldn't enjoy Tom Cruise

Bridge
G#                D#                   Fm        Cm
Tom Cruise knows somewhere there's a place for him
G#           D#             Fm     G7
He's not of this world anymore...

Verse 3
C            E            A7
Somewhere in some secluded castle
Dm                                 G7
Poor Tom Cruise sits staring at the wall
        C                E            A7
And the outside world is always such a hassle
Dm                          G7  E
Sometimes he won't go out at all
          F            C
There are millions who know his name
Dm       Am
Everybody loves him
F              C            G7
Why is it that he feels so alone?

Chorus
C   E        F          C
Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise crazy
Dm               G7      C     G7

I'm ashamed of half the things I say.

and I desire to make amends.

Am G

    C                  G
But it don't make no difference, now,
     C                      F
and no-one's listening, anyhow,
     C                        F
and lists of sins and solemn vows
        F      G      Am
don't make you any friends.

Am G

            C
There's an old trick played,

when the light and the wine conspire
                      F
to make me think I'm fine.
     C                          F
I'm not, but I have got half a mind
          G         Am
to maybe get there, yet.

Am G
          C                G
When the sky goes pink in Paris, France,
         C                            F
do you think of the girl who used to dance
             C                           F
when you'd frame her moving within your hands,
               G       Am
saying This I won't forget?

Am G

      C               G
What happened to the man you were,
          C                     F
when you loved somebody before her?
        C  
Did he die?
                    F               G   Am
Or does that man endure, somewhere far away?

Am G

      C                       G
Our lives come easy and our lives come hard.
        C                         F
And we carry them like a pack of cards:
     C                              F
some we don't use, but we don't discard,
                G     Am
but keep for a rainy day.

I believed our peril was done,

after three we had narrowly won.

(But the fourth, it was carelessly done.)


        Dm          Gm          C   Eb
Saw his ship in its whistling ascension,
        Ab                Dm      G7
as they launched from the Capitol seat—
        Bb      E7               A7     Dm
swear I saw our mistake when the clouds draped
       Bb               Eb           F
like a flag, across the backs of the fleet
       Bb            Eb         F
of the Hundred-First Lightborne Elite.


       Am     Bb           Dm        F
As the day is long, so the well runs dry,
       Eb                  Bb          F        C
and we came to see Time is taller than Space is wide.
       Am   Bb             Dm    F
And we bade goodbye to the Great Divide:
        Eb      Bb              F   C
found unlimited simulacreage to colonize!


                Am           Bb            Dm  Bb
But there was a time we were lashed to the prow
     F            Bb             Dm
of a ship you may board, but not steer,
       Am        Bb             Dm    Bb
before You and I ceased to mean Now,
      F           Bb         Dm
and began to mean only Right Here
         F          Bb             F
(to mean Inches and Miles, but not Years);


       Dm          Gm           C   Eb
before Space had a taste of its limits,
      Ab          Dm          G7
and a new sort of coordinate awoke,
        Bb       E7           A7     Dm
making Time just another poor tenant:
        Bb             Eb             F
bearing weight, taking fire, trading smokes,
       Bb          Eb          F
in the war between us and our ghosts.


               Am     Bb             Dm     F
(But I saw the Bering Strait and the Golden Gate,

in silent suspension of their golden age!
            Am     Bb         Dm       F
And you can barely tell, if I guard it well,
      Eb               Bb       F        C
where I have been, and seen, pristine, unfelled.)


            Am           Bb            Dm Bb
And I had a dream that I walked in the garden
      F              Bb        Dm
of Chabot, and those telescope ruins.
       Am           Bb           Dm   Bb
It was there that I called to my true love,
        F          Bb      Dm
who was pale as millennial moons,
       F             Bb           F
Honey, where did you come by that wound?


        Dm          Gm          C         Eb
When I woke, he was gone and the War had begun,
    Ab     Dm         G7
in eternal return and repeat.
         Bb           E7           A7           Dm
Calling, Where in the hell are the rest of your fellow
    Bb          Eb            F
One Hundred-One Lightborne Elite?
               Bb           Eb         F
stormed in the New Highland Light Infantry.


        Am       Bb            Dm       F
Make it stop, my love! We were wrong to try.
      Eb                  Bb        F         C
Never saw what we could unravel, in traveling light,

or how the trip debrides—like a stack of slides!
       Eb                   Bb          F        C
All we saw was that Time is taller than Space is wide.


                  Am          Bb          Dm Bb
That's why we got bound to a round desert island,
           F             Bb           Dm
'neath the sky where our sailors have gone.
          Am                 Bb   Dm   Bb
Have they drowned, in those windy highlands?

Highlands away, my John.

    G                        Dm
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
       F             C             G
Of the big lake they called gitche gumee
    G                       Dm
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
         F        C             G
When the skies of November turn gloomy
       G                           Dm
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
         F          C              G
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty.
     G                        Dm
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
         F          C           G
When the gales of November came early.

    G                          Dm
The ship was the pride of the American side
       F              C          G
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
       G                         Dm
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
       F             C            G
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
   G                         Dm
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
          F          C          G
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
    G                         Dm
And later that night when the ships bell rang
         F      C                      G
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin? 

G Dm F C G  F C G





    G                        Dm
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
      F          C        G
And a wave broke over the railing
    G                      Dm
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
         F          C           G
Twas the witch of November come stealin.
    G                      Dm
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
         F          C           G
When the gales of November came slashing.
     G                     Dm
When afternoon came it was freezing rain
       F         C         G
In the face of a hurricane west wind.


G Dm F C G  F C G

     G                        Dm
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck saying
F            C            G
Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya.
   G                 Dm
At seven p.m. a main hatchway caved in, he said
F            C            G
Fellas, it's been good to know ya
    G                       Dm
The captain wired in he had water coming in
        F             C           G
And the good ship and crew was in peril.
    G                         Dm
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
         F            C          G
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.

G Dm F C G  F C G








     G                      Dm
Does any one know where the love of God goes
         F              C          G
When the waves turn the minutes to hours? 
    G                            Dm
The searches all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
          F                C       G
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her.
     G                           Dm
They might have split up or they might have capsized;
F              C             G
May have broke deep and took water.
    G                       Dm
And all that remains is the faces and the names
       F             C            G
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters.

G Dm F C G  F C G

G                     Dm
Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
       F            C         G
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion.
    G                      Dm
Old Michigan steams like a young mans dreams;
    F           C            G
The islands and bays are for sportsmen.
    G                    Dm
And farther below lake Ontario

Takes in what Lake Erie can send her,
        G                    Dm
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
         F          C        G
With the gales of November remembered.

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed,

In the maritime sailors cathedral.

The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times

For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald.

Living on the road my friend

Is gonna keep you free and clean
F (2)                
Now you wear your skin like iron
C                      G
Your breath as hard as kerosene
F (2)                                       
Weren't your mama's only boy

But her favorite one it seems
    Am                    / F    C /    G (2)
She began to cry when you said good  - bye
    F                Am (2)       
And sank into your dreams

 
C (2)                                         
Pancho was a bandit, boys, his
G (2)
horse was fast as polished steel

He wore his gun outside his pants

For all the honest world to feel
 F (2)                                   
Pancho met his match you know on the
 C               F
deserts down in Mexico
 Am             / F C /  G (2)           
Nobody heard his dying words
      F                Am (2)  
but that's the way it goes
 
CHORUS:
F (2)

         F             Am (2)       
out of kindness I suppose
 
  C (2)                            
Lefty he can't sing the blues
G (2)
all night long like he used to
      F (2)                                  
The dust that Pancho bit down south
C            G
ended up in Lefty's mouth
      F                            
The day they laid poor Pancho low
 C              F
Lefty split for Ohio
Am               / F    C /  G (2)

Poets tell how Pancho fell and
G (2)
Lefty's living in a cheap hotel
     F (2)
The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold,
C                G
And so the story ends we're told
F (2)                                      
Pancho needs your prayers it's true but
  C             F
save a few for Lefty too
    Am             / F   C /  G (2)
He only did what he had to   do 
     F               Am (2)
and now he's growing old

A few gray Federales say 
 C                 F
could have had him any day
Am                  / F  C /   G (2)

Morning walks and bedroom talks, oh, how I loved you then


Summer skies and lullabies, nights we couldn't say goodbye,
And of all of the things that we knew, not a dream survived.
Photographs and memories, all the love you gave to me,
Somehow it just can't be true, that's all I've left of you.

If there's anything to say, if there's anything to do,
If there's any other way, I'll do anything for you.

I was dressed embarrassment.
I was dressed in wine.
If you had a part of me, will you take you're time?
Even if I come back, even if I die
Is there some idea to replace my life?
Like a father to impress;
Like a mother's mourning dress,
If you ever make a mess, I'll do anything for you

I have called you preacher; I have called you son.
If you have a father or if you haven't one,
I'll do anything for you. I did everything for you

Thinking outrageously I write in cursive

I hide in my bed with the lights on the floor

Wearing three layers of coats and leg warmers
  G                         Em
I see my own breath on the face of the door

D       Bm
Oh I am not quite sleeping
G       Em
Oh I am fast in bed
D                        Bm

I see a wasp with her wings outstretched

D                   Bm
North of Savanna we swim in the palisades
G                     Em
I come out wearing my brother's red hat
D                        Bm
There on his shoulder my best friend is bit seven times
G                   Em
He runs washing his face in his hands

D        Bm
Oh how I meant to tease him
G        Em
Oh how I meant no harm
D                         Bm
Touching his back with my hand I kiss him

I can tell you, we swaggered and swayed
            Bm                  G
Deep in the tower, the prairies below
       Em                        D
I can tell you, the telling gets old
         Bm                 G
Terrible sting and terrible storm
      Em                       D
I can tell you the day we were born
             Bm           G
My friend is gone, he ran away
      Em                        D
I can tell you, I love him each day
               Bm                    G
Though we have sparred, wrestled and raged
      Em                       D
I can tell you I love him each day
         Bm              G
Terrible sting, terrible storm
      Em         ...D
I can tell you...
